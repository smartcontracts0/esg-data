The \nTR sets out the framework and environmental objectives for the Taxonomy, as well as new legal obligations for financial market \nparticipants, large companies, the EU and Member States. \nThe TR will be supplemented by delegated acts which contain detailed technical screening criteria for determining when an \neconomic activity can be considered sustainable, and hence can be considered Taxonomy-aligned. The European Commission \nestablished a Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, which was tasked with developing recommendations on a range \nof topics, including what the Taxonomy technical screening criteria should be for the objectives of climate change mitigation and \nadaptation. \nThis report sets out the TEG\u2019s final recommendations to the European Commission. This report contains \nrecommendations relating to the overarching design of the Taxonomy, as well as guidance on how users of the Taxonomy can \ndevelop Taxonomy disclosures. It contains a summary of the economic activities covered by the technical screening criteria. \nThis report is supplemented by a Technical Annex containing: \n\u2022 \nA full list of revised or additional technical screening criteria for economic activities which can substantially contribute to \nclimate change mitigation or adaptation (including assessment of significant harm to other environmental objectives); and \n\u2022 \nMethodological statements to support the above recommendations. \nThese recommendations have been developed over 20 months and with substantial consultation and scientific and technical \ninput. The TEG has received input from all parts of the investment chain, industry sector representatives, academia, \nenvironmental experts, civil society and public bodies. Combined, these reports contain detailed explanation of the rationale and \nmethodologies behind the TEG\u2019s conclusions. \nThese reports supersede the two previous reports from the TEG (early feedback report \u2013 Dec 2018, technical report \n\u2013 June 2019). \nThis report represents the overall view of the members of the Technical Expert Group. However, although it \nrepresents such a consensus, it may not necessarily, on all details, represent the individual views of member \ninstitutions or experts.

Following an in-\ntroductory chapter identifying the Group\u2019s basic strategic \nprinciples, the Economy, Society and Environment chap-\nters illustrate the three central dimensions of sustainabili-\nty. Each chapter outlines principles of sustainability at \nVolkswagen, using specific measures and projects initiated \nby the various Group brands to illustrate them. The key sus-\ntainability indicators are set out on page 134ff., while the \nBackground chapter starting on page 155 includes informa-\ntion on reporting standards and their verification. \nThe reporting period extends from February 15, 2012, \nwhen the previous report went to press, to March 1, 2013. \nThe key indicators, however, relate to the 2012 calendar \nyear. Volkswagen has published its Sustainability Report \non an annual basis since 2011. The next report will be pub-\nlished in the second quarter of 2014. \nThe report has been prepared in accordance with the \nstandards of Germany\u2019s Institute for Ecological Econo-\nmy Research (I\u00d6W) and the Global Reporting Initiative \n(GRI). It has also been verified in line with the interna-\ntionally recognised Stakeholder Engagement Standard \nAccountAbility 1000 AS (AA1000). This confirms the reli-\nability of the reporting and the engagement of stake-\nholders in the reporting process (> p. 22). Certification \nto this effect can be found in the Background chapter. \nUse of language\nAll the information in this report relates to the Volkswagen \nGroup as a whole.

We have \nalready made good progress in areas such \nas energy efficiency and \u00advocational train-\ning \u2013 and we are proud of these efforts. \nHowever, we still have a long way to go in \nother areas; workforce diversity is one \nexample. \nOur commitment to sustainability forms \npart of our fiduciary duty to act in the best \ninterests of the company and its stake-\nholders.

Our first\nencounter with it was in China, where we reacted quickly to protect our employees, customers\nand partners \u2013 with great success. This allowed us to effectively stabilise the business and to\ncomplete the disposal of METRO China\u2019s majority stake to Wumei. The knowledge and\nexperience gained during the coronavirus crisis in that region helped us enormously in\nresponding quickly to the outbreak of the pandemic in Europe. We set 3 priorities: protect,\npreserve, grow. What does that mean in concrete terms?\nProtect: our employees, customers and\npartners are our top priority, which is why\nwe rapidly implemented high safety and\nhygiene standards in our stores,\nwarehouses and administrative offices.\nPreserve: we have initiated measures for\nthe entire METRO portfolio based on local\ndemand in order to ensure the quality and\navailability of goods, but also to secure\nour financial situation.\nGrow: every crisis also brings hidden\nopportunities. That is why we started\nlooking for new growth opportunities\nimmediately after the outbreak of the\npandemic.

Our analysts collaborate with responsible investment experts to better \nunderstand the impact of ESG considerations on company performance and\u2014increasingly\u2014to advocate \nfor advancements in behavior and business practices. \nOur analysts and portfolio managers share insights using proprietary research and collaboration tools. \nPRISM, a fixed-income credit rating and scoring system, includes ESG scores assigned to each issuer by \nAB analysts that are accessible to investment professionals in real time. Equity analysts use ESIGHT, a \nproprietary ESG research collaboration platform where AB analysts input their ESG assessments and \nresults from company engagements, and house third-party research. Analysts also exchange \nperspectives across asset classes to gain a more complete picture of investments. \nESG considerations have long been integrated in our investment process, because they\u2019re critical to \nmaking informed risk/return assessments and investment conclusions. The methods of applying ESG \nconsiderations vary. Some teams directly incorporate ESG concerns into their discount rate; others \ninclude ESG insights in the information mosaic that shapes investment decisions.  \nIn 2019, AB\u2019s analysts\u2014often collaborating with our responsible investing specialists\u2014conducted 328 \nESG-focused engagements with issuers. It was a global effort, addressing issues across the ESG \nspectrum: 45% of engagements were on governance, 35% on social issues and 20% on environmental.  \nOften, these engagements cover multiple topics. We expect engagement on social and environmental \nissues to increase over time.  \n \nThe engagement examples in the following pages are intended to be a representative sample of our \nengagements on environmental, social and governance issues with firms in diverse industries and \n\ngeographies. Collectively, we believe they provide perspective on how we\u2019re engaging companies on \nESG issues.  \nEnvironmental Engagement \n \nReckitt Benckiser (Household Products)  \nWe had multiple engagements with this UK-based multinational consumer goods company in 2019 on \nthe management of its product carbon footprint, climate change risks, greenhouse gas emissions and \nsocial impact on communities. These issues provide Reckitt Benckiser with opportunities to improve \noperational performance and enhance its position with consumers who are increasingly supporting \nbrands with strong environmental focus on sustainable production and packaging. \nThe company had set several ambitious environmental goals for 2020 including a 40% reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions stemming from manufacturing, a 35% reduction in energy consumption and a \n33% reduction in carbon footprint. At the time of our engagement with Reckitt Benckiser in May 2019, \nthe company had reduced emissions by 35.2% and energy consumption by 22.6%, but its carbon \nfootprint was only 4% smaller. The company had also targeted a transition to 100% renewable energy by \n2030, which is ambitious given that the renewable sourcing for manufacturing sites was 30%. \n \nReckitt Benckiser uses carbon lifecycle modeling to understand and manage its climate change risks and \nimpacts throughout the value chain. To improve its environmental profile and achieve its goals, the \ncompany is implementing energy-efficient production processes, investing in purchased and on-site \nrenewable energy, and advancing its sustainable innovation program.  \n \nDespite these efforts, our ongoing engagement with Reckitt Benckiser revealed that the company is not \nadequately focused on executing its environmental strategy, as observed in the underperformance \ntowards its own stated 2020 environmental targets. During meetings with company management in the \nthird quarter, we re-iterated our view that effectively managing emissions and energy consumption was \ncritical to improving operational performance. However, we ultimately concluded that Reckitt Benckiser \nwas not fully executing its high-profile environmental initiatives \u2013 presenting a potential long-term risk \nto the company\u2019s brand and reputation with consumers.  \n \nAlthough we are continuing to monitor the company\u2019s progress in these areas and plan to continue our \nengagements in 2020, we have lowered our price target due to the lack of tangible focus on the \nenvironmental risks identified and discussed.     \n \nSuzano (Paper Products)  \nBrazil-based Suzano is one of the largest paper and eucalyptus pulp producers in the world, with \nbusinesses including forestry, cellulose, paper, biotechnology, Eucafluff, tissue and lignin.

They address all its \nimpacts and engage its whole value chain \n\u2013\u00a0from product design to distribution\u00a0\u2013 \nincluding the production process and the \nsourcing of raw materials. These \ncommitments are organised into four \npillars: innovating sustainably, producing \nsustainably, living sustainably and sharing \ngrowth with employees, suppliers and the \ncommunities with which L\u2019Or\u00e9al interacts. \nEvery year, L\u2019Or\u00e9al measures its progress \nquantitatively, making its results available to \neveryone. By upholding its commitment to \ncontinuous improvement, L\u2019Or\u00e9al maintains \nan ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders, \nin order to share its sustainability strategy \nand co-create its initiatives.

Product sustainability is \nnow just as fundamental a criterion as \nquality and profitability. Moreover, our \nnon-financial results are edited in the \nsame way as our financial results. In \n2019, 85% of our new or renovated \nproducts already had an improved \nsocial or environmental profile.

We now target a full ESG integration in our \nStrategies; i.e. a systematic and explicit inclusion of ESG risks and \nopportunities across our quantitative engines. \nBelow, we have presented an overview of our data sources, \nmethodology and results. \nFor professional investors only  -  Promotional document\n2\n\nESG data\n\nRAM\u2019s Systematic Equity: A leading approach to ESG Integration, 2019 \nESG data\nESG data : A growing source of information\nOver the last decade, awareness \nsurrounding ESG issues has been growing \nrapidly, with investors increasingly \nincorporating non-financial information into \ntheir analysis. Companies and third party \nentities are responding to this demand by \nproviding an ever-expanding range of data, \nboth in terms of their coverage and diversity \nof fields. RAM\u2019s research approach is one \nof constant evolution; trying to ensure we \nnever neglect any possible information \nsource that could be integrated into our \nprocess and thus could enable us to \nbetter-capture the inefficiencies we seek \nto exploit . We view this new availability of \ndata as a potential source of alpha, bringing \na complementary profile to the existing \ninformation-set already captured by our \nfactors. We have already explored several \nalternatives in accessing ESG data.\nIn 2011, fewer than 20% of S&P500 \ncompanies disclosed their ESG data. In \n2016, the number of companies issuing \nsustainability or integrated reports has \nincreased to over 80% [1]. According to \nKPMG, circa 75% of the N100 companies \n(defined as the top 100 companies by \nrevenue in 49 countries) released annual \nsustainability reports.[2] Bloomberg collects \nand publishes this data alongside financial \nreports, covering 9,000 stocks globally, and \nremains our preferred source for accessing \nreported data. \nOur testing also includes major ESG data \nand ratings providers, covering either the \nfull spectrum of criteria or a specific angle \nsuch as CDP (ex-Carbon Disclosure Project). \nCDP is a not-for-profit charity that collects, \non behalf of investors,  environmental data \nprovided on a voluntary basis. We use this \nas one of our sources when measuring a \ncompany\u2019s Carbon Footprint.

It also exposed and\nexacerbated broader trends in society, bringing to light our role in confronting inequalities associated with systemic \nracism and historical disadvantages that people of color face.\nAfter we parked aircraft, adjusted policies and procedures, and ensured a healthy and safe operation, we quickly \nshifted our focus to rebounding stronger and seizing new opportunities made available from the pandemic to better \nposition JetBlue once travel returned. How could we apply lessons learned in responding to the pandemic to the \nmitigation of future risks?\nUltimately for us, our experiences in 2020 only reinforced the importance of mitigating risks that threaten the \nhealth of our business. Although at times challenging, we have only sharpened our focus on all things ESG \u2013 \nincluding identifying, tracking, and responding to the wide variety of threats our business may face in the future.\nAs such, 2020 was not just the year of COVID-19 \u2013 it was also the year that we became the first U.S. airline to \nachieve domestic carbon neutrality, realized today through large-scale carbon offsetting. It was also the year we \nbegan flying regularly on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from San Francisco International Airport \u2013 allowing us to \nreduce lifecycle emissions up to 80% per gallon of delivered neat fuel.\n2020 was also the year we launched our Diversity Leadership Council and a reimagined company-wide focus on \nconfronting and correcting potential biases and inequalities in our communities and workplace. It was also the \nyear we stood up our ESG Subcommittee of our Board of Directors, allowing for more focused discussion and \nadvancement of key ESG issues at the highest level of company leadership.\nAs we move forward, we see substantial business opportunity associated with the climate transition and movement \ntoward a more just, diverse and inclusive business. We are inspired by our crewmembers\u2019 and industry\u2019s resiliency \nand the unparalleled focus and commitment from other corporations, governments, and individuals to work \ntogether and do better.

Our international presence \nhas also helped us to learn the lessons of \nthe Covid-19 epidemic in China and \nprepare for its global spread, adapting our \nbusiness continuity plans to the \nexceptional circumstances brought about \nby Covid-19.\nOur priority at all times is protecting the \nhealth of our employees.

However, recent \ndevelopments indicate that the true transition in the \nfield of non-financial reporting is yet to come. \nI.\nBackground \nSince January 2017, certain large undertakings are \nrequired to provide ESG and diversity related disclosures \nunder the Luxembourg law of 23 July 20161. The high-\nlevel requirements of the law were accompanied by non-\nbinding guidelines of the European Commission \npublished in July 20172, recommending as key principles \nthat the information provided should be:  \n\uf0b7\nMaterial, \n\uf0b7\nFair, balanced and understandable, \n\uf0b7\nComprehensive but concise, \n\uf0b7\nStrategic and forward-looking, \n\uf0b7\nStakeholder oriented, and \n\uf0b7\nConsistent and coherent. \nWith the launch of the EU Action Plan on Sustainable \nFinance in 2018 and the introduction of the EU Green \nDeal in 2020, ESG reporting has become critical for all \nmajor players in the financial market. Reporting entities \nshould get ready for a new era of sustainability \nreporting.  \nII.\nAdditional guidelines by the Commission \nIn June 2019, the European Commission provided \nsupplemental non-binding guidelines focusing on the \ndisclosure \nof \nclimate-related \ninformation3. \nThese \nguidelines seek to fill the gap in climate-related data by \nencouraging reporting entities to provide material, \nsufficient, reliable and comparable information on the \nfinancial and non-financial impact of climate change on \n1 Luxembourg law of 23 July 2016 on the publication of non-\nfinancial information, available here: \nhttp://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2016/07/23/n19/jo\n2 available here:  \nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-\ncontent/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52017XC0705(01) \n3 available here:\nhttps://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-\ncontent/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52019XC0620(01)\n\n2 \n10 March 2020\nthe entity as well as the entity\u2019s impact on climate \nchange. \nThe \nguidelines \nare \nbased \non \nthe \nrecommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosure (TCFD) established by the G20\u2019s \nFinancial Stability Board and thus benefit from \ninternational recognition.  \n\u201cGiven the systemic and persuasive impacts of climate \nchange, most companies [\u2026] are likely to conclude that \nclimate is a material issue.\u201d \nEuropean Commission, Guidelines of June 2019 \nWhile these guidelines are, at this stage, non-binding, \nentities in the scope of the NFRD should take this \ndevelopment seriously. Assessing their climate change \nimpact and climate change\u2019s impact on them in line with \nthe guidelines will be a difficult task and require both \ntime and training. In the meantime, the European \nCommission is successfully promoting incentives to \ncomply voluntarily by massively pushing investors\u2019 \ndemand for such information.

It is highly likely that their recommendations \nwill influence the Commission\u2019s proposal for a new \nregulation.  \nIn February 2020, the CSSF published its second report4\nfocusing on the quality of the disclosure compared to \nthe key principles introduced by the Commission\u2019s 2017 \nguidelines.

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "\n\nSHARING\nSHARING\n\n4\nSUSTAINIBILITY REPORT 2021\nWe have arrived at our seventh Sustainability Report, published, as always, on a voluntary basis to share with \nyou the vision of our polar star during the year in which vaccination campaigns, in which we had the burden and \nthe honour of taking part with our technologies, were widely disseminated: to guarantee satisfactory economic \nresults for the company and well-being for our employees, without ever losing sight of the limited availability of \nthe planet\u2019s resources and respect for the land in which we operate.\nThe past year has been one of highs and lows. The pandemic caused a perfect storm that affected the ganglia \nof our economy and our daily lives. Fortunately, despite its atavistic criticalities, the country\u2019s system reacted, \nraising its head - as always - in times of great difficulty, with the aim of rebuilding a new normality.\nWe did the same as a company, by reflexively involving all those who are directly and indirectly responsible for \nthe operation of our business. I refer first of all to our customers around the world: our greatest effort has been \nto create and standardise new procedures for the testing and delivery of our technologies. Then I am talking \nabout our suppliers, an operational microcosm made up of small and very small production companies whose \nwork is essential for the proper functioning of the Group.\nThe integrity of the socio-economic fabric of the entire country depends on the nourishment and development \nof this fragmented yet strategic supply chain: that is why we have inaugurated an innovative Master\u2019s degree \nprogramme dedicated exclusively to our sub-supply chain.\nI was talking about reconstruction. In 2021, with this in mind, we decided to focus even more on the values of \nidentity and solidarity by setting up the Marchesini ACT Foundation, an acronym that stands for the concepts of \nAvant-garde, Culture and Territory. Avant-garde understood as innovation, curiosity, a drive towards the new, \nand a love for research; Culture signifies not only knowledge and technical culture, but also inclusion through \nknowledge, diversity as a value and mutual enrichment; and, finally, Territory, with a focus on the enhancement \nof people as well as local and national traditions.\nIf the Foundation can be understood as our eye to the outside world, corporate welfare - to which part of the \nnew Sustainability Report is dedicated \u2013 represents an increasingly intense and multifaceted focus on our \nemployees, to whom my gratitude and greetings go. All of them, in different ways and forms, have contributed \nto the achievement of the company\u2019s results, partly also thanks to their willingness to vaccinate themselves at \nan early stage and to follow the recommendations and advice aimed at leading our large family into the future.\nA future that - I am sure - will be bright for all those who share dreams and work together, step by step, to build \nits foundations. \nMaurizio Marchesini\nPRESIDENT\n\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n5\nIt has been a turbulent year. We have had to deal with the consequences of a pandemic of unthinkable scale, which \nwas followed by a similarly unimaginable military conflict - as early as November 2021, international observers had \nreported Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian borders. \nAs an osmotic creature by definition, the company is affected by everything that happens around it. That is why - in a \ncontext that has shaken seemingly solid businesses and brought unprecedented circumstances to the fore - we are \nall the more proud of having preserved and even improved our objectives.\nTo achieve this, we relied on our all-Italian ability to successfully deal with the most critical exogenous variables, \ndrawing heavily on our \u201cknow how\u201d - which is almost 50 years old but not so set in stone that it cannot mutate. It has \nrequired, more than ever in these hectic times, a constant and determined spirit of adaptation. We would never have \nimagined testing drug packaging machines remotely \u2013 but this is exactly what we did. We would never have thought \nit possible to build a vaccine packaging line in just six months \u2013 and yet we did so! It was not in our plans to schedule \nmore flexible working hours for our employees \u2013 but our plans changed. The face of the world is changing, with \nlittle or no notice; if companies wish to not only survive but also continue to grow, they must reshape their historical \nparadigms to suit the present. This is called resilience: an abused term, which nevertheless perfectly expresses the \nmantra that inspires the new normal in our business. \nAnd our packaging machine business remains strong: in 2021 the sector\u2019s turnover stood at EUR 8.5 billion, up 8% \non the previous year. These are impressive figures, but we must not rest on our laurels. New social sensitivities are \ncalling for more research and development on sustainable materials, which is why we have invested in Rinova - our \nbrand of second li", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Record growth took our earnings to \nnew heights, with total revenue, EBITDA and \nnet profit respectively growing by 14%, 18% \nand 31% like-for-like. 2021 was also a year of \nmajor ESG progress, with our ESG indicators \nwell in line to reach our 2022 and 2030 \ntargets.\nWe owe this success to our relentless \ninnovation efforts, the relevance of our \nsolutions, the soundness of our business \nmodel \u2013 but above all, we owe it to the \ncommitment of 10,000 Edenreders. Each \nday, they work with passion to serve nearly\n1 million customers, 2 million merchants and \n50 million users. I feel fortunate to be a part \nof such a Dream Team.\nIn the past two years, we have seen the \nconcrete impact of the health crisis on \nEdenred\u2019s businesses and markets. How \nwere you able to adapt and react?\nEdenred demonstrated remarkable resilience \nin the face of the sudden economic shutdown \nthat affected our business in 2020. Even \nthough the public health situation has \nremained an area of concern, particularly in \nLatin America, our latest results show that \nwe have more than erased the impact of the \nCovid crisis. \nMoreover, the pandemic has reinforced \ncertain trends that are favorable to us, such \nas the increase of remote working, the shift \nto digital and mobile usages and the call for \nmore responsible behaviors.\nIn fact, I am convinced that Edenred has not \nyet reached its full potential.\nEdenred is very different from what it was \nfive years ago, tech-wise. What are the \nmain aspects of this transformation and \nhow does it support our strategy?\nThat\u2019s right: from a tech perspective, we could \nsay that Edenred has been reborn a digital \nnative. By investing heavily in technology \nsince 2016 \u2013 more than \u20ac300 million this year \n\u2013, not only has Edenred disrupted its business \nmodel, but it has also established itself as the \nleader of its industry in digital innovation.\nToday, 100% of our new solutions are digital \nand the share of our digital business volume \nhas increased from 70% to 90% in five years.\nWe are a key player in mobile payment and \napp-to-app connections: think that Edenred \nusers can now order meals from over\n200 delivery partners worldwide.\nWe are also developing new promising \nservices in all our business lines by leveraging \ndata \nscience \nand \nartificial \nintelligence \nalong with our community of 150 data \npractitioners.  \nOur platform helps us achieve our objective: \nto provide people at work with a best-in-class, \nsimple, secure and flexible experience. In a \nnutshell: the everyday companion for people \nat work.\n\nIntegrated Report 2021-2022 \u2022 5\n2021 was the year Edenred\u2019s purpose, \n\u201cEnrich \nconnections. \nFor \ngood.\u201d \nwas \nunveiled. One year later, how would you \ndescribe its meaning for your teams and \necosystem?\nBy defining our purpose, we took a step back \nto reflect on our North Star, on what guides \nus in everything we are doing. \nOne year later, I can truly feel our purpose \ndisseminating; every time I meet with the \nteams across the world, I feel this sense of \nbelonging around this commitment. Also, \nour solutions are great embodiments of this \npurpose.\nAs an example, take Agri Edenred, a digital \nsolution chosen by the government of \nCameroon that quickly, easily, and securely \ngrants agricultural subsidies to 600,000 \nfarmers.

For most cancers, a \ndiagnosis in early stages means a much better chance of survival than a \ndiagnosis in late stages. Our team is developing tests that help detect \nmost cancers in earlier stages, as well as recurrence of cancer before \ndetectable with the most sensitive imaging. We plan to change the way \npeople screen for, are diagnosed with, and treat cancer. Our core values \nof integrity, innovation, accountability, quality, and teamwork ensure we \nwork toward our goal in a sustainable way.\nThe policies and programs described in this report are important \ncomponents of our sustainability initiative: to facilitate cancer prevention \nand smarter cancer care. The work we do every day is aimed at \neliminating the suffering cancer causes to create a more enduring, \ncancer-free world for future generations. The success of Exact Sciences \nwould reduce the economic and social burden of cancer care around the \nworld.\nIn this report, we highlight our key sustainability focus areas, which are:\n\u2022 human capital,\n\u2022 community engagement,\n\u2022 business ethics,\n\u2022 product quality,\n\u2022 access to health care, and\n\u2022 environmental stewardship.\nWe are committed to taking care of the patients we serve, their health \ncare providers, our employees, supporting the communities in which \nwe work, behaving ethically, making our services accessible broadly, \nand protecting our environment. \nWe\u2019re focused on making our current advanced cancer diagnostic tests \n\u2013 Cologuard\u00ae, Oncotype\u00ae, and Oncomap\u2122 \u2013 and our pipeline tests \u2013 the\nbiggest, boldest, and highest impact opportunities in cancer diagnostics\n\u2013 available to more people around the world.

Employees hold a\nprivileged position within the value chain. Training and\nskills development are therefore essential resources for\nM6, which also relies on the expertise of teams and the\nintellectual property of formats and brands, as well and an\nextensive catalogue of audiovisual rights.\n- Financial and industrial resources, which are the capital\ninvested by shareholders as well as the profits generated\nover the years and reinvested in the development of M6\nGroup. M6 Group also uses buildings, studios, warehouses,\nfacilities, etc. to create value.\n- Corporate, social and environmental resources, which are\nsimultaneously the natural resources utilised (electricity,\npaper, etc.) as well as M6 Group\u2019s commitments to\nsociety, the relationships between the Group\u2019s brands,\nviewers, listeners, etc.\n\u25cfFor each of the Group\u2019s business cycles (which are grouped\ninto 4 segments of financial information), there are\ncorresponding values created by M6 (audiovisual content,\nchannels, etc.) that form the basis of financial and non-\nfinancial performance.\n7.1.1.2 CSR CHALLENGES \nFaced with various corporate, social and environmental \nchallenges, M6 Group has been pursuing an active CSR policy for \nmany years and clearly states its commitments to all its \npartners: it has developed a CSR policy structured around four \npriorities, directly related to its activities: \n\u25cfRespect for the public and responsibility towards society:\nsince the Group\u2019s activity is primarily intangible and cultural,\nthe societal impact is the unifying thread of its commitment.\nThrough its programmes, the Group actually enters into\npeoples\u2019 homes and therefore respect for viewers must be at\nthe heart of what it does.\n\u25cfTalent management: the Group firmly believes that its\nemployees are the cornerstone of its success. It is for this\nreason that the Human Resources Department places\nemployee selection and subsequent loyalty building at the\nheart of its concerns, and endeavours to promote employee\ndevelopment in all aspects of their professional life.\n\u25cfNon-discrimination: taking diversity into account is a key\nconcern for the Group, both in relation to audiovisual\ncontent and the audience it addresses. This is reflected\nnotably by a cross-organisational and acknowledged\ncommit", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "2021\nANNUAL \nHAZELNUT \nACTION PLAN \n\n2021 ANNUAL HAZELNUT ACTION PLAN \nFERRERO \u2013 RESPONSIBLE SOURCING APPROACH \nTHE FOUR-STEP RESPONSIBLE SOURCING APPROACH IS \nALIGNED TO OUR POLICIES AND GUIDES OUR CHARTERS FOR \nOUR KEY RAW MATERIALS:\nResponsible sourcing is embedded in the way Ferrero does business. \nAt Ferrero we take a continuous improvement approach to responsible \nsourcing. Our approach is built around supplier management, a robust due \ndiligence, traceability and transparency, certi\ufb01cations and standards. We \nknow more can be achieved together and long-term partnerships and \ncollaborations are essential. We take a risk-based approach and when needed \nwe invest in our supply chains through targeted programmes to improve their \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) conditions and their overall \nstandards. Through the activities of our sustainability programme, Ferrero \nFarming Values (FFV), we work to make a di\ufb00erence to the supply chains in \nwhich we operate.\nOur responsible sourcing approach is founded on four steps (illustration on \nthe right). Our Supplier Code re\ufb02ects our basic requirement of Supplier Risk \nManagement (Due Diligence). The building blocks above this step refer to our \nCharters for our key raw materials, including hazelnuts, palm oil and others. \nLearn more in our Sustainability Report.\nThe Hazelnut Charter sets out our vision for a hazelnut industry which, \nthrough continuous improvement, creates value for all. It outlines our \nlong-term commitments with speci\ufb01c mid-term objectives (2023). Our aim is \nto be a driving force behind a hazelnut industry where farming communities \nare thriving, workers and children\u2019s rights are respected, and environmental \nvalues are enhanced through regenerative agricultural practices. \nSupplier Risk \nManagement \n(Due diligence)\nSupply Chain \nVisibility\nStandards and \nCerti\ufb01cations\nProgrammes\n1. CONTEXT\nThis Supplier Code is subject to the Ferrero\u2019s \nHuman Rights Policy Statement and is \ncomplimentary to the Code of Business Conduct \n(COBC) and, therefore, does not amend and/or \noverride the COBC and/or any provisions and/or \nany agreements, arrangements and contracts \nwith the Supplier. \nThis Supplier Code will be followed by a due \ndiligence-based approach. Upon completing the \ndue diligence, the Supplier Code may be followed \nby speci\ufb01c Charter documents establishing \nFerrero\u2019s commitments based on selected \npriorities of the Ferrero Group.\n2. APPLICATION AND SIGNIFICANCE\nThis Supplier Code applies to all Suppliers, i.e. all \nvendors and sellers that produce, trade, sell, \nlease and/or provide goods or services that enter \nFerrero\u2019s supply chain and where such vendors \nand sellers have a direct commercial relationship \nwith Ferrero (Supplier). \nThis Supplier Code focuses on three pillars that \nare strategically important for the Ferrero Group: \nHuman Rights and Social Practices,\nEnvironmental Protection and Sustainability\nSupplier Transparency.\nEach of the areas set out in this Supplier Code \nrequires the development and deployment of \nmultiple initiatives on an ongoing basis. We \nrecognize the need to collaborate with our \nSuppliers on each of these initiatives to develop \nspeci\ufb01c and achievable targets, milestones and \nprojects in each of these areas. The \nimplementation process will be reasonably \ntailored to the size and associated risks from a \nSupplier\u2019s operations.\nWe, the Ferrero Group (Ferrero) believe that partnerships and collaboration with \nour suppliers is a mutually bene\ufb01cial and inclusive way to ensure responsible \nsourcing throughout our supply chain. Partnerships build trust not only with our \nsuppliers, but also along the entire value chain. We are committed to working \nwith our suppliers on a journey of continuous improvement and strongly believe \nit will create common and shared bene\ufb01ts to us, our suppliers and all \ncommunities where we operate. \nThis  Supplier Code allows us to engage our Suppliers and ensure a supply chain \nthat is fair, sustainable and transparent.\n1\nFERRE O GROUP FERRERO SUPPLIER CODE\nFERRERO \nSUPPLIER CODE\nOUR AMBITION\nOur ambition is to be a driving force behind a \nhazelnut industry where hazelnut production \ncreates value for all; farmers and farming \ncommunities are thriving, workers\u2019 and children\u2019s \nrights are unequivocally respected, and \nenvironmental values are enhanced through \nregenerative agriculture practices. \nFor Ferrero, ensuring compliance with our own \nprinciples (Ferrero\u2019s Human Rights Policy \nStatement and Ferrero Supplier Code), with \napplicable laws and regulatory requirements is a \nBasic Requirement. We monitor compliance of \nour suppliers to these requirements through \nvalue chain traceability, a robust Due Diligence \nand Consequence Management approach. We \nhighlight clear principles and expectations under \nthe Basic Requirements which we require our \nsuppliers to acknowledge through the Ferrero \nSupplier Code.   \nAt the same time, we are convinced that Ferrero \nmust Go Beyond th", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

At ADI \nwe have long held the belief that we can and should \nbe a force for positive change in the world. Now nearly \n25,000 employees strong, our acquisition of Maxim \nIntegrated gives us the opportunity to take an even \nstronger leadership position in driving the changes \nthat must take place to create a better society and a \nhealthier planet. \"\nAt ADI we have long held the belief that we can and should be a \nforce for positive change in the world.\u201d \nEnvironment, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles \nare at the heart of everything we do, but not just \nbecause we believe it\u2019s the morally right thing to do. \nPut simply, ESG is smart business. The efforts we \ntake across ADI to operate with integrity, preserve \nthe environment, slow down and remediate climate \nchange, and inject greater diversity, equity, and \ninclusion, both within our leadership and workforce, \nare key to our long-term growth and profitability. \nWe rigorously pursue profitable growth, but do so with \na focus on delivering positive impact to the world: \n\u2022 ADI solutions, for example, are shaping the future \nof healthcare and enabling greater, more equitable \naccess.

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "1\nCISCO 2021 TCFD\nCisco 2021 Task Force on Climate-Related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) Response\nBuilding on our new net zero commitment announced in September 2021, we plan to review and update our \nTCFD analysis in fiscal 2022. The results will be disclosed as part of Cisco\u2019s fiscal 2022 ESG reporting. \nTCFD was established to assess potential business impacts of climate change, including efforts to reduce GHG \nemissions and to mitigate the impact of climate change. These impacts can potentially emerge over a time period \nmeasured in decades and for which typical business forecasting is not well suited. Suggested TCFD methodology \nfocuses on evaluating scenarios. Per section B.2 of TCFD Technical Supplement, The Use of Scenario Analysis in \nDisclosure of Climate Related Risks and Opportunities: \nIt is important to remember that scenarios are hypothetical constructs; they are not forecasts or predictions \nnor are they sensitivity analyses\u2026 Scenario analysis is a tool to enhance critical strategic thinking. A key \nfeature of scenarios is that they should challenge conventional wisdom about the future.\nSection B.2 of the Technical Supplement further explains that scenarios should be plausible, distinctive, \nconsistent, relevant and challenging. \nThe science and scenarios \nThe impact of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is projected to have increasing \nimpacts on climate as the global average temperature increases due to the retention of energy previously \nradiated into space. The Data shown in the chart Atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory gives a clear \nview of the potential for climate change given the unabated increases in CO2 concentrations that interfere with \nblack body re-radiation. The Mauna Loa data only reports on CO2. Other GHG emissions, such as methane and \nchlorofluorocarbons, are also increasing, contributing to the absorption of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth. \nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to increase and are increasing at a faster rate (see figure on/showing \nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa Observatory)\nBefore 1960, the rate of increase was less than 1 ppm CO2 /yr. Today the increase is more than 2.5 ppm/yr, with \nthe absolute CO2 concentration increasing from around 315 ppm CO2 to about 415 ppm CO2. Extrapolating to \nthe year 2050, CO2 concentrations will likely approach or even exceed 500 ppm CO2. This path to 500 ppm by \n2050 has been chosen as our base-case scenario. This base case includes GHG reduction efforts implemented \nworldwide to date and that may continue, but which have not had an appreciable impact on GHG concentrations \nin the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nFrom the IPCC report, Climate Change 2014 \u2013 Synthesis Report (see figure on or showing Atmospheric CO2 \nconcentrations for the past 800,000 years), the increase in CO2 concentration above the historic maximum of 280 \nppm has gone from 35 ppm CO2 in 1960 to 135 ppm CO2 in 2020 (280+35=315 ppm, the approximate CO2 \nconcentration in 1960; 280+135=415 ppm, the approximate CO2 concentration in 2020). \nPer the IPCC report, Climate Change 2014 \u2013 Synthesis Report (Table 3.1, p. 22), 500 ppm in 2050 is indicative of a \n3\u00b0 C temperature rise \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d Continued increases in GHG concentration through 2100 would further \npush temperature upward. Cisco is using the \u201c2050 base case\u201d for its scenario construction and risk assessment.\nA second scenario is constructed projecting that, as of some future date, there will be no net impact on GHG \nconcentrations from Cisco operations or from its products.

In partic-\nular, various elements causing instability, such as reduced automobile produc-\ntion due to semiconductor shortage, rapid rise in ocean freight as a result of the \nglobal logistics disruption, increased prices of raw materials, and anti-dumping \ntariff imposition by the US, wielded a negative impact on the tire industry. It also \naffected NEXEN TIRE. Despite record-high sales of KRW 2.0794 trillion, our oper-\nating profit was only KRW 4.4 billion due to the impact of the internal and exter-\nnal environment. However, we established a basis for securing a future growth \nengine by producing remarkable performances, which include expansion of sup-\nply to premium automotive companies such as Porsche and Audi, designation as \nthe best supplier by Stellantis, awarding Podium prize in Toyota 86/BRZ Race, and \nreceipt of the Grand Prize in the Korea Labor-Management Cooperation Awards.\nThis year, although the unstable management environment persists, we will \nmove forward to grow into a sustainable company by actively responding to the \nchallenges and tasks we face. To this end, we will implement the following strat-\negies. In order to minimize the impact of instability in the global supply chain, \nNEXEN TIRE will establish mid- to long-term response strategies for shipping \ncompanies and increase the percentage of overseas sales by securing local dis-\ntribution bases. We will also strengthen core competencies by business sector in \norder to realize customer delight, establish a multi-plant production system, and \nsecure quality competitiveness in", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The tragic events unfolding in \nUkraine have had an unimaginable human toll but also serve to remind us of the complexity and \nsecurity of the global energy supply network. We are proud of the role Precision Drilling plays as a \nclean, socially responsible, and ethically governed participant in the upstream energy supply chain. \nThe key elements of \u201cESG,\u201d environmental impact and climate change, social impact, and ethical \ngovernance, are foundational to Precision\u2019s business strategy as our competitive advantage is \nbased on our ability to provide highly skilled, safety-focused, and disciplined crews on our High-\nPerformance drilling rigs.\nIn 2019, we completed our first companywide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions baseline \nassessment and have continued this practice for 2020 and 2021. In 2022, we will use the results \nfrom these assessments to develop our long-term plan to achieve net zero. We believe a net zero \ntarget for our business is achievable, but the timeline is uncertain as some of the technology and \nenergy infrastructure required are well beyond our scope of influence.\nOur rigs are designed to drill efficiently, which requires less energy, produces lower GHG emissions, \nand reduces environmental impact. Precision has a long history of developing technologies \nand systems to improve the efficiency of our rigs and reduce environmental impact, from the \nintroduction of our Super Single rig in the 1990\u2019s to the commercialization of AlphaAutomationTM in \n2019. Over 40% of our active fleet is equipped to operate with natural gas. In 2021, we introduced \nour EverGreenTM Suite of Environmental Solutions with several products and apps to help our \ncustomers measure and reduce their emissions during drilling operations. \nWe believe geothermal energy will be an important energy component in the net zero global energy \nmix. Precision has participated in geothermal projects for the past 25 years and in early 2022, \nPrecision increased its commitment to geothermal energy with a direct investment in EavorTM, a \ngeothermal technology corporation. We are also excited to partner with Cornell University and \nthe U.S. Department of Energy to drill an exploratory geothermal well in Ithaca, NY with a Precision \nEverGreen\u2122 zero emissions rig.\nWe view our employees and the communities where we operate as part of the Precision family \nand offer training programs, employee development opportunities, family events, and community \nparticipation events that ensure Precision Drilling is both a great place to work and a strong \nKEVIN NEVEU\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\npartner within our communities. Our focused efforts in training, safety, diversity, equity, inclusion, \nharassment prevention, and community engagement were strengthened in 2021 following the \neasing of the pandemic restrictions. In 2021 we implemented Serious Injury and Fatality incident \n(SIF) as a key safety metric and have incorporated a SIF reduction target into our safety planning.\nPrecision\u2019s Board of Directors and management believe exceptional corporate governance is \nessential and aligns with our strategy of operational discipline.

Details and quality are key.\u201d Comprehensively improve the \nvision health for public \n \nUniversal Vision Biotechnology, UVB, has been the pioneer in Taiwan that introduced cataract surgery and refractive \nsurgery technology and equipment to the market. The core of the Company's business is to provide our cooperative \nclinics with professional administrative supports and services including brand licensing, location assessment, store \nrenovation and expansion, space and equipment leasing, drug and medical supply sales, and other general affairs. \nUVB has also assisted cooperative clinics in obtaining a number of national and international recognitions and \ncertifications over years, such as SNQ (Symbol of National Quality), ISO9000 and the significant JCI (Joint \nCommission International) Accreditation. Together with our cooperative clinics, we are committed to bringing the \nbest quality of medical care and improving vision health for the public. \n \nUVB\u2019s management is teamed with professionals from ophthalmology as well as business administration \nbackgrounds. Having a deep and thorough understanding of the vision health industry, we believes that the \noutdated approaches of medical care being cold, serious, and rigid should be injected with more personal touch \nand respect. Therefore, UVB is dedicated to offering patients a more comfortable and satisfying experience when \nreceiving treatments at our cooperative clinics. Meanwhile, to make it a one stop shopping convenience for \ncustomers, we integrate self-operated optical services and products with medical care from the cooperative clinics, \nmaking vision health easier and better. \n \nIn adherence to the mission of improving medical quality and sustainable development with our cooperative clinics, \nUVB has taken concerted efforts for the continuous growth in 2021. While pursuing operational growth, the \nCompany also implements good corporate governance, sustainable development and social responsibilities, in \norder to elevate operational quality and corporate value. We always pay attention to changes in the competitive \nenvironment, regulatory environment, and the macroeconomy as well so as to reduce the impact of the Company\u2019s \noperations on the environment. \n \nIn 2022, UVB established the \u201cNominating Committee\u201d and the \u201cGovernance & Sustainable Development Office\u201d to \nimprove ESG practices with all employees. With the joint efforts of our colleagues, we completed the first voluntary \nESG report. Besides, UVB has maintained at top 6%-20% among the OTC-listed companies in the 8th Corporate \nGovernance Evaluation (2020). This year, UVB continues to dedicate to the principle of integrity and transparency, \nin addition to quarterly investor conferences and regular responses to investors\u2019 questions, we engaged in meeting \ninternational standards by publishing the annual report, quarterly financial statements, shareholders\u2019 meeting \nnotices and agenda, and material information all in English in a timely manner, as part of the efforts to achieve the \ngoal of ranking top 5% in Corporate Governance Evaluation. \n \nGoing forward, UVB will continue to expand on channels to serve more consumers, in the hopes of enabling the \npublic to \u201cSee Clear, See Comfort, See the Future!\u201d as our vision to strive for. We also endeavor to become the No. \n1 brand in the vision biotech industry.

In addition, the \nnon-financial group report is intended to help \nanalyze the opportunities and risks associated with \nthese aspects. \nThis non-financial group report of Porsche SE  \nfor the fiscal year 2021 follows the commercial  \nlaw requirements of Sec. 315b HGB \n[\u201cHandelsgesetzbuch\u201d: German Commercial Code] \nas well as the extended reporting obligations of \nArticle 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 18 June \n2020 (EU Taxonomy Regulation). In accordance with \nSec. 289d HGB, it was considered which national, \nEuropean or international frameworks could be \nused for the preparation of the non-financial group \nreport. The Porsche SE Group currently opts not to \nuse such a framework on account of deviating \ndefinitions of materiality between the frameworks \nand the legal requirements as well as the \nunreasonable cost-benefit ratio in light of the \ncurrent corporate structure. The future use of a \nframework will be regularly evaluated; in particular, \nthe current assessment may change with the \nacquisition of additional investments. \nReporting covers Porsche SE and the fully \nconsolidated entities included in the consolidated \nfinancial statements of the Porsche SE Group in the \nreporting year. The Porsche SE Group does not \nhave control over its other investments, meaning \nthat it can encourage sustainable corporate \ngovernance at these investments only through the \nshareholder dialogue and board work.  \nReporting on the Porsche SE Group mainly focuses \non the non-financial aspects environmental matters, \nemployee-related matters, social matters, respect \nfor human rights and anti-corruption and bribery \nmatters. \n \n\n3\n2021\t\nNon-financial group report of Porsche SE\nBusiness model of the Porsche SE Group \nPorsche SE is a holding company with investments \nin the areas of mobility and industrial technology. In \nparticular, it holds the majority of the ordinary \nshares in Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft \n(\u201cVolkswagen AG\u201d, \u201cVolkswagen\u201d or \u201cVW\u201d), one of \nthe world\u2019s leading automobile manufacturers. As \nthe parent company of the Volkswagen Group, \nVolkswagen AG directly and indirectly holds \ninvestments in AUDI AG, SEAT S.A., \u0160KODA AUTO \na.s., Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, TRATON SE, \nVolkswagen Financial Services AG, Volkswagen \nBank GmbH and in numerous other companies in \nGermany and abroad. In addition to the investment \nin Volkswagen, the Porsche SE Group holds PTV \nPlanung Transport Verkehr GmbH, Karlsruhe \n(formerly PTV Planung Transport Verkehr AG, \nKarlsruhe) (\u201cPTV\u201d, together with its subsidiaries the \n\u201cPTV Group\u201d), which was fully consolidated until  \n31 December 2021, as well as non-controlling \ninterests in seven further technology companies in \nthe USA, Israel and Germany.  \nThe investment strategy of Porsche SE aims for \nsustainable value creation for its shareholders. This \nis based on the increase in value of assets under \nmanagement as well as dividend distributions. \nPorsche SE\u2019s investments are divided into two \ncategories. The first category includes the long-term \ncore investment in Volkswagen AG. The second \ncategory comprises portfolio investments that \nPorsche SE generally holds for a limited period of \ntime. Such investments are typically characterized \nby a high potential for growth and for increasing \nvalue during the holding period. The sector focus in \nboth investment categories lies in mobility and \nindustrial technology. \nBefore acquiring investments, Porsche SE \nconsiders both financial and non-financial aspects \nof the target company. The scope of these \ninvestigations depends considerably on the \ncompany\u2019s business model and market coverage. \nIn addition to the core investment in Volkswagen, \nthe Porsche SE Group has invested over the past \nfew years in several companies that have significant \nsustainability aspects anchored in their business \nmodels. With their software solutions and data \nportfolio, the PTV Group and INRIX Inc., Kirkland, \nWashington (\u201cINRIX\u201d), aim to optimize traffic and \ntransport routes, thereby making a significant \ncontribution to reducing the consumption of \nresources and lowering emissions.

We \nrecorded major successes during the year and continued to invest in the Group\u2019s medium-term growth, while \nalso delivering on our CSR commitments, which will be further developed in our new roadmap.

We are keeping a close eye on the \nhumanitarian situation with great attention and concern for the people involved. The impact on 2022 is difficult \nto measure at this stage, even though the Group has no direct exposure to the region.  \nHowever, we remain confident in our future prospects, allowing us to unveil our medium-term ambition today. \nBy 2025, we aim to harness buoyant sustainable development markets like renewable energies, electronics \nand green transportation, and Mersen\u2019s key role in these segments, to generate sales of around \u20ac1.2 billion.\u201d \n \n \n\n \nPRESS RELEASE \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPAGE 2 OF 13 \n \nWWW.MERSEN.COM \n \nKey figures  \n2021 \n2020 \nChange \nSales (\u20acm) \n923 \n847 \n+8.9% \nOperating margin before non-recurring items \n10.0% \n8.1% \n+190 pts \nEBITDA margin \n16.1% \n14.5% \n+160 pts \nNet income/(loss) attributable to owners of the parent (\u20acm) \n54.4 \n(12.0) \n+\u20ac66m \nROCE  \n10.8% \n7.8% \n+300 pts \nNet debt/EBITDA ratio \n1.42 \n1.65 \n-23 pts \nDividend per share (\u20ac) \n1.00 \n0.65 \n+53.8% \n \nFor the definitions, please refer to the glossary at the end of this press release. \n \nACTIVITY, EBITDA AND OPERATING INCOME BEFORE NON-RECURRING ITEMS \nMersen reported consolidated sales of \u20ac923 million in 2021, up 8.6% on an organic basis compared with \n2020. Sales grew by 8.9% taking into account, on the one hand, the negative currency effect of around \n\u20ac7 million and, on the other hand, the consolidation of GAB Neumann, Americarb and Fusetech of around \n\u20ac10 million.  \nOverall, sustainable development markets (including renewable energies, electronics and green \ntransportation) grew by nearly 10% year on year to 56% of total sales, compared with 51% of total sales in \n20191.  \nOperating income before non-recurring items came to \u20ac92.6 million, resulting in an operating margin before \nnon-recurring items of 10%, an increase of 190 basis points. This improvement is largely driven by positive \nvolume and mix effects.

Furthermore, price increases helped to partially \noffset the rise in raw material and energy costs.  \nGroup EBITDA came to \u20ac148.8 million, representing a margin of 16.1%, up 160 basis points on 2020.  \nAdvanced Materials segment \nAdvanced Materials sales totaled \u20ac507 million, up 6.7% on an organic basis compared with 2020.

The Iberdrola Group is a multinational energy corporation based in \nBilbao, Spain. The Group was established in 1992 and has since then grown into one of the \nlargest energy groups worldwide. The Group\u2019s activities range from the production of electricity \nfrom conventional and renewable resources and the sale and purchase of electricity and gas in \nthe wholesale markets, to the transmission and distribution of electricity and gas. It is predom-\ninantly active in Brazil, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States of America, but \nalso has a smaller presence in many other countries.  \nDuring the 2021 business year Iberdrola generated revenues of EUR 39,114 million (2020: EUR \n33,145 million), EBITDA of EUR 11,516 million (2020: EUR 9,516 million), EBIT of EUR 7,326 million \n(2020: EUR 5,551 million) and net profit of EUR 4,352 million (2020: EUR 3,952 million). \nRating result \nThe current unsolicited corporate issuer rating of Iberdrola S.A. attests a good level of credit-\nworthiness representing a low to medium default risk. The main positive factors contributing to \nthe rating result are Iberdrola\u2019s balanced financial profile, as well as its large amount of regu-\nlated revenues and long-term contracts (PPA\u2019s), which significantly reduces market price and \nvolume risks. Furthermore, the geographically diversified asset base and income generation \nalso contributes positively to the current rating result. Regulatory risks, particularly with regard \nto the Networks business, are for a large extent mitigated due to the high number of different \nregulatory regimes. The increasing capacity in renewables increases exposure to adverse \nweather conditions. However, this is to a large extent mitigated by a high degree of diversifica-\ntion in terms of geography and energy source (Wind, Hydro, Solar). \nRating object \nRating information \nIberdrola S.A.  \n \nCreditreform ID: \n2000000597 \nIncorporation:   \n1992 \nBased in:  \nBilbao, Spain \nMain (Industry): \nEnergy distribution, generation and transmission \nCEO: \n                 Jos\u00e9 Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Gal\u00e1n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRating objects: \nLong-term Corporate issuer Rating: Iberdrola S.A. \nLong-term Corporate Issuer Rating: Rating Iberdrola International B.V. \nLong-term Corporate Issuer Rating: Iberdrola Finanzas S.A.U. \nLong-term Corporate Issuer Rating: Iberdrola Finance Ireland DAC \nLong-term Local Currency Senior Unsecured Issues, issued by Iberdrola International \nB.V. \nLong-term Local Currency Senior Unsecured Issues, issued by Iberdrola Finanzas S.A.U. \nLong-term Local Currency Senior Unsecured Issues, issued by Iberdrola Finance Ire-\nland DAC \n SME / Corporate Issuer Rating: \n BBB+ / stable \nType: \nUpdate \nUnsolicited \nPublic rating \n LT LC Senior Unsecured Issues,:  \n BBB+ / stable \nOther:  \nn.r. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRating date: \n19 October 2022 \nMonitoring until: \nwithdrawal of the rating \nRating methodology: CRA \u201cCorporate Ratings\u201c \nCRA \u201cNon-Financial Corporate Issue Ratings\u201c \nCRA \u201cRating Criteria and Definitions\u201c \nRating history:  www.creditreform-rating.de \nContent \n \nSummary ....................................... 1 \nRelevant rating factors ................. 2 \nBusiness \ndevelopment \nand \noutlook .......................................... 5 \nStructural risk ............................... 7 \nBusiness risk ................................. 8 \nFinancial risk ............................... 10 \nFinancial ratio analysis ............... 15 \nAnalysts \n \nRudger van Mook \nLead Analyst \nR.vanMook@creditreform-rating.de \n \n \nArtur Kapica \nCo-Analyst \nA.Kapica@creditreform-rating.de \n \n \n \nNeuss, Germany \n\n \n\u00a9 Creditreform Rating AG 2022 \n19 October 2022 \n2/20 \nCreditreform Corporate Issuer / Issue Rating \nIberdrola S.A. \n \nThe current volatility on European energy markets have not had a significant effect on the \nGroup\u2019s performance as a whole.

Nevertheless, in order to retain its leadership position in the energy transition, Iberdrola \nwill invest EUR 75 billion in the period between 2020 and 2025 and EUR 150 billion in the period \nup to 2030 to finance the continuance of its energy transition.

This has been a \ncritical factor in ensuring our continued success. \nAs the regulatory environment continues to expand, \nwe have seen numerous developments, including the \nimplementation of the Norwegian Transparency Act \nand the inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions \nTrading Systems (EU ETS). At Golden Ocean, we \nsupport these developments as we see them as enablers \nfor a more balanced sustainability landscape, which \ncorresponds with our commitment to ensuring ESG \nrisks and opportunities remain at the core of our \nbusiness strategy.\nWe have maintained a strategic focus on digitization to \nensure we have accessible ESG data. This investment \nallows us to extract relevant vessel performance data \nfrom our digital ESG management platform whenever \nwe need it, enabling data-driven decision-making. This \npermits us to optimize our operations to increase fuel \nefficiency and reduce emissions. Moreover, it provides \nour Board of Directors (BoD) with the necessary \ninformation to discuss ESG topics at BoD meetings, \nensuring that we stay on top of our performance. \nOur investment in maintaining a modern, energy-\nefficient fleet enables us to be ambitious in our \nemissions reduction targets. We have set targets for \nscope 1 emission reduction and aim to reduce our \nCarbon Intensity Indicator (CII) values by 15% by \n2026 and 30% by 2030, compared to 2019. We have \nalso set an ambition to reach net-zero by 2050. The \nstrength of our young fleet, with an average age of 6.5 \nyears and superior fuel economics, is one of the core \nenvironmental pillars of our sustainability strategy. \nOur energy efficiency project \u2013 \u201cDecarbonization \njourney toward IMO 2030-2050\u201d \u2013 has provided us \nwith a solid basis for assessing our operations, with a \nparticular focus on how to further optimize our fleet to \nmeet our targets.

Successivamente sono state numerose, a livello globale, le iniziative volte a favorire la creazione \ndi una regolamentazione comune, ad esempio, in tema di emissioni inquinanti e investimenti green. \nPer rimanere nell\u2019ambito europeo, a partire dal 2015, alcuni Stati hanno sottoscritto accordi chiave per \nun futuro sostenibile: dapprima, l\u2019Agenda 2030 per lo sviluppo sostenibile, sottoscritta nel settembre \n2015 dai governi dei 193 Paesi membri dell\u2019ONU; successivamente, l\u2019Accordo di Parigi sui cambiamenti \nclimatici - firmato il 22 aprile 2016 e ratificato dall\u2019Unione europea il 5 ottobre 2016 - che si propone di \nrafforzare la risposta ai cambiamenti climatici, tra l\u2019altro, rendendo i flussi finanziari compatibili con un \npercorso che conduca a uno sviluppo a basse emissioni di gas a effetto serra e resiliente dal punto di \nvista climatico. \nIn tale contesto, l\u2019Unione europea, si \u00e8 da subito impegnata nella transizione verso modelli di crescita \nincludenti tematiche ambientali; ci\u00f2 ha portato al lancio del Piano d\u2019Azione (marzo 2018) con l\u2019obiettivo \ndi finanziare la crescita sostenibile, di incrementare gli investimenti in progetti sostenibili e di promuo-\nvere l\u2019integrazione dei criteri ambientali, sociali e di governance (Environmental, Social and Governance \n- ESG).\nIl Piano d\u2019Azione UE ha scandito le \u201ctappe\u201d della marcia della sostenibilit\u00e0 in dieci punti, al fine di intro-\nDonato Varani, Partner, Annunziata & \nConso\nDaniel Lunetta, Annunziata & Conso\n  Donato Varani\nDonato Varani \u00e8 Dottore Commercialista e Revisore \nlegale dei conti dal 1993.

There were no signifi\u00ad\ncant impacts either in terms of management of liquidity, which remained solid and stable, or in terms of strategic \nobjectives and direction, characterised by an increasing integration of sustainability into the business mod\u00ad\nel. Established from the outset as a company oriented towards long-term sustainable growth, Fineco has in fact \ncontinued to operate in line with its corporate purpose: \u201cto support clients in the responsible management of \ntheir savings in order to create the conditions for a more prosperous and fairer society\u201d. \nThis goal is pursued through the Group\u2019s continuous investment in the three pillars of transparency, efficiency \nand innovation, which have always guided our strategy and our growth journey, offering customers excellent \nservices and products at a fair price within the three integrated business areas of banking, investing and bro\u00ad\nkerage.\nThe constant look to the future that guides business decisions is also the cornerstone of our approach to sus\u00ad\ntainability. Accordingly, in 2022 we adopted the Net Zero Commitment, setting ourselves the important goal \nof achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. \nThe commitment to combating climate change is part of the Group\u2019s subscription to the United Nations sus\u00ad\ntainability initiatives \u2013 namely the Principles of the Global Compact, the Principles for Responsible Banking \nand the Principles for Responsible Investment \u2013 and is part of the ESG Plan, which saw the achievement of \nimportant milestones during the year. In terms of client offering, Fineco Asset Management has strengthened \nits range of ESG products and the integration of environmental, social and governance criteria into its invest\u00ad\nment management activities. The Bank has also expanded the availability of ESG-rated funds and the range of \nESG-rated financial products, meeting the important challenge of offering customers products and services that \nare increasingly aligned to their sustainability preferences. \nIn September 2022, FinecoBank obtained EMAS Registration, a recognition that certifies the excellence of the \nEnvironmental Management System, implemented throughout the Italian offices and Fineco Centers accord\u00ad\ning to the requirements of the European EMAS Regulation. \nIn the knowledge that the ability to innovate and continuous evolution cannot be separated from the nurturing \n\n5\nof human capital and the richness derived from the diversity of its composition, we have continued to invest in \nthe growth of our employees and personal financial advisors an", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

To deliver on the objectives that we established in our previous report, SMP has \nmade significant enhancements to our environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) \nprofile. During 2022, we prioritized the following initiatives to advance our commitment to \nbeing environmentally and socially responsible:\n\u2022\t\nidentify and implement practices that contribute to a greener car parc;\n\u2022\t\nreduce our carbon footprint and make progress towards our ambition to achieve net-\nzero greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions by 2050;\n\u2022\t\nenhance our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging programs; \n\u2022\t\nenhance employee training, development, retention, while prioritizing their health and \nsafety; \n\u2022\t\nimprove the diversity of our Board of Directors; \n\u2022\t\nensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, while furthering our \ncommitment to align our ESG reporting with established reporting standards; and\n\u2022\t\nappointed a director of global sustainability to analyze opportunities, develop strategies \nand monitor our environmental supply chain efforts worldwide.\n\t\n\t\nWe believe that these initiatives, and the integration of a sustainable approach to our \nbusiness, will provide long-term value to our Company, stakeholders, and the communities \nwithin which we operate.\n\t\n\t\nOver the 100-plus years that we have been in business, we have challenged ourselves \nto take advantage of the opportunities that technological advancements have presented \nto us. Today, SMP is prepared to meet the growing demand for high-quality replacement \nparts of hybrid and electric vehicles through our broad offerings of conventional and future-\noriented technologies. We have invested in an original equipment manufacturer of electric \ndrive compressors for HVAC and battery cooling in electric and hybrid vehicles. Additionally, \nin 2022 alone, we\u2019ve expanded our product offering through the introduction of more than \n1,400 new parts for powertrain-neutral applications and another 300 components for \nhybrid and electric vehicles. Our engineers have also successfully developed fuel injectors \nfor engines that use hydrogen, compressed natural gas, and liquid natural gas to replace \ndiesel fuel with clean-burning alternatives. Additionally, our remanufacturing program \nrecycles certain used automotive parts, producing same-as-new components that promote \nsustainable manufacturing practices and contribute to a cleaner car parc.\n\t\n\t\nWe also have continued to challenge ourselves to identify and implement solutions \nto reduce our environmental impact while achieving our business objectives. In our 2021 \nA MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO\nThough we recognize the challenges that lie ahead, we remain \ncommitted to leveraging sustainability as a catalyst for positive \nchange both within our organization and in the communities \nwithin which we operate.\n\n2022 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n4\nSustainability Report, we announced our ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by \n2050. To that end, we have partnered with third-parties to help us track our GHG emissions \nand develop a roadmap to achieve our reduction targets. We are also in the process of \ntransitioning our sales force vehicles to hybrid electric vehicles to reduce fuel costs and \nScope 1 GHG emissions. In 2022, facility upgrades aimed at improving energy efficiency \nand reducing energy usage have helped us reduce our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG \nemissions (intensity) by 11% compared to 2021 and 30% compared to 2019.

Coffee is one \nof the world\u2019s most traded commodities and \nconsumed beverages (Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations [FAO], \n2022b). The coffee plant is a shrub or small \ntree that needs about 3\u20134 years to start \nproducing red cherries, which are then \nstrip- or hand-harvested (National Coffee \nAssociation, n.d.). Strip harvesting, which \ncan be mechanized, involves removing all \nthe cherries from the branch at once, while \nhand harvesting, a more labour-intensive \nprocess, consists of selectively harvesting \nripened cherries. Harvested coffee cherries \nare processed immediately using a dry or wet \nmethod to facilitate the milling process, which \ninvolves hulling to extract the coffee bean \n(green coffee) and an optional polishing step \nbefore being graded and sorted by weight, \nsize, and quality so they can be sold (National \nCoffee Association, n.d.). Green coffee beans \nare then roasted to unlock their flavour, \nbecoming brown roasted beans, which are \nground and brewed to produce the coffee \nbeverage we commonly enjoy. \nArabica and Robusta are the two main \ncoffee species that have come to dominate \nthe market, with global production in 2020 \nconsisting of about 58% Arabica and 42% \nRobusta (International Coffee Organization, \n2021, p. 9). While many factors affect quality, \nArabica coffee has historically been considered \nhigher quality as it has a smoother, sweeter \ntaste. Robusta has twice the caffeine content, \nmaking it more bitter and well suited for \nready-to-drink applications and espresso \nblends (Petruzzello, 2021). Fine Robusta \nStandards and Protocols were introduced \nin 2019 to improve the quality of coffee \nmade with Robusta (Impallomeni, 2019). \nThe Arabica coffee plant is more sensitive \nto higher temperatures and must be grown \nin subtropical climates at altitudes of 600 m \nto 2,000 m. It is well suited for agroforestry \nand shaded environments (Petruzzello, \n2021). Robusta coffee is more resistant to \ntemperature fluctuations and can be grown \nfrom sea level to 600 m in full sun (Petruzzello, \n2021). It is also more disease resistant and \nMarket Overview\n\nIISD.org/ssi    \n2\nGlobal Market Report\ngenerally produces higher yields. Today, coffee \nhas become a highly sophisticated product, \nwith producers and roasters developing a \nwide range of varietals and flavours to meet \ndifferent users\u2019 expectations and to respond to \nconsumption trends.\nThe coffee sector has grown into a lucrative \nbusiness downstream, reaching a retail market \nvalue of approximately USD 102 billion in \n2020. It is expected to continue expanding at \na compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of \nat least 4.28% from 2021 to 2026 (Mordor \nIntelligence, 2021). The coffee value chain \nprovides direct employment to an estimated \n125 million people worldwide (Fairtrade \nFoundation, 2022). The U.S. coffee industry \nalone employed almost 1.7 million people in \n2015. Coffee is grown on 12.5 million farms \naround the world, predominantly run by \nsmallholder farmers cultivating 5 ha or less\u2014\nindeed, 95% of coffee farms span 5 ha or less \nand 84% span less than 2 ha (Panhuysen & \nPierrot, 2020, p. 56). Smallholder farmers \naccount for most global coffee production as \nthey comprise 73%\u201380% of coffee farmers \nglobally (Fairtrade Foundation, 2022; \nPanhuysen & Pierrot, 2020, p. 56). Larger \nestates produce the remainder, with coffee \nestates greater than 50 ha rarely found \noutside of Central and South America \n(Panhuysen & Pierrot, 2020, p. 56).\nLIVELIHOODS\nThere are 12.5 million coffee farms in the world. \n95% of coffee farms have an area of 5 ha or less. \n84% have less than 2 ha.\nFigure 1. Global coffee production from 2008 to 2019. Coffee that complies with voluntary \nsustainability standards (VSSs) reached 21% to 45.4% of total production in 2019.\nNote: Conventional production volumes do not comply with a VSS, while VSS-compliant production volumes \nrefer to coffee produced in compliance with at least one VSS.

These efforts make it possible \nfor the next generation of aerospace workers \nto continue to enjoy rewarding careers, \nstrengthen the fabric of the communities where \nwe operate, and collaborate within our industry \nfor environmental stewardship (E), social \nprogress (S) and transparent governance (G).\nBoeing\u2019s mission is to protect, connect and \nexplore our world and beyond. Every day, we \nare dedicated to carrying out our mission \u2014 \nsafely and sustainably. Boeing is pursuing \nsustainable aerospace together because we \nknow it is an imperative and because our \nteammates are committed to making the \nworld better for future generations.\nThroughout Boeing\u2019s long history, we have \nlooked for ways to enhance sustainability in \neverything we do. This commitment to \ninnovate is deeply rooted in our core values, \nwhere we continue to reinforce safety as our \ntop priority, strive for first-time quality and hold \nourselves to the highest ethical standards to \nsupport a more sustainable future.\nBy 2050, our industry sees a world where air \ntravel will carry over 10 billion passengers a \nyear, support 180 million jobs and generate \nnearly $9 trillion in economic activity, all while \nfurthering our goal of minimizing the impact \non our planet and striving to achieve the \ncommercial aviation industry\u2019s ambition \nof net-zero carbon emissions. Aerospace also \ncontinues to be essential to national security, \nhumanitarian and peacekeeping efforts around \nthe globe. We are committed to preserving the \nsocietal, security and economic benefits of our \nindustry, safely and sustainably. \nAdvancing the future of flight and improving \nthe world for future generations requires a \nmulti-faceted approach. Our focus on ESG is \nembedded in our culture and our stakeholders\u2019 \nexpectations, including our current and \nfuture employees, customers, regulators, \nsuppliers, communities and investors.\nEnvironmental Stewardship\nTo address climate change, Boeing continues \nto collaborate with partners across the globe \non innovation and clean technology to get \ncommercial aviation to net-zero carbon \nemissions. We\u2019re finding more efficient ways \nfor our commercial and defense customers to \noperate their fleets, and we\u2019re investing heavily \nin sustainable aviation fuels, considered the \nsafest and most measurable solution to reduce \naviation carbon emissions over the next 20 \nto 30 years. We continue to test the latest \ntechnologies to cut emissions, reduce noise \nand enhance safety with our ecoDemonstrator \nprogram, which celebrates its 10th anniversary \nthis year, while investing in and demonstrating \nalternative fuel solutions to inform the future \nof flight. We are committed to maintaining \nnet-zero carbon emissions within our \noperations as we advance the design-for-\nenvironment view of our defense and \ncommercial products and build sustainability \ninto every step of our product life cycle. \nDave Calhoun, President and CEO\n2022 Sustainability Report  3\nContents\nPeople\nIntroduction\nCommunities\nO", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

These elements of accountability are \nall critical to stable, profitable and sustainable business environments in which \ncompanies thrive and\u00a0economies prosper.\n\t\n\u2014 Civic space has been shrinking around the world in democratic and autocratic \ncountries alike for some time. For investors and companies, which face growing \npublic expectations that they should act responsibly, and which have increasing \ninfluence over global affairs, the reduction of civic space presents not only \npolitical but also legal, ethical, reputational and financial risks.\n\t\n\u2014 Currently, there are several barriers to\u00a0investor support for civic freedoms, \nincluding short-term decision-making; political sensitivities in\u00a0relationships \namong investors, companies and host governments; the difficulty of\u00a0measuring \nand integrating civic space issues into traditional investor methodology; \nand\u00a0insufficient internal governance to\u00a0support attention to\u00a0these issues.\n\t\n\u2014 Awareness among investors of\u00a0the materiality of\u00a0civic freedoms will take time \nto\u00a0grow as\u00a0forms of\u00a0measurement and engagement are refined. In\u00a0the meantime, \npositive trends include emerging scrutiny of\u00a0civic space issues by\u00a0some large \ninstitutional investors and\u00a0companies; increasing regulation mandating corporate \nhuman rights due diligence; and a\u00a0new generation that cares more about social \nvalues and is\u00a0quick to\u00a0mobilize in support online.\n\t\n\u2014 For investors to\u00a0demonstrate geopolitical corporate responsibility and match \ntheir rhetoric on\u00a0social purpose with action, there needs to\u00a0be a\u00a0shift in\u00a0both \nculture and process. By\u00a0undertaking more comprehensive human rights \ndue diligence and by\u00a0increasing engagement with civil society stakeholders, \ninvestors and companies would be\u00a0better able to\u00a0identify and mitigate risks \nrelating to\u00a0civic space.\n\n2\u2002 Chatham House\nInvestors and the ESG blind spot\nUpholding civic freedoms as part of geopolitical corporate responsibility\nIntroduction\nUntil the last decade, \u2018corporate social responsibility\u2019 was mostly a\u00a0\u2018tick-box\u2019 \nexercise for investors, many of\u00a0whom followed the doctrine of\u00a0Milton Friedman \nthat a\u00a0company\u2019s social responsibility is\u00a0to maximize profits and returns to\u00a0its \nshareholders. But, there has been a\u00a0gradual shift in\u00a0attitude and practice amid \nrising societal expectations of\u00a0business\u00a0\u2013 whether on\u00a0carbon emissions, worker \nsafety or\u00a0diversity.1 Recent events such as\u00a0the emergence of the Black Lives Matter \nmovement, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of\u00a0Ukraine have all \nforced business to\u00a0recognize and grapple with the links between values, reputation \nand profitability.\nBusiness and civil society operate in, and benefit from, a\u00a0shared space defined by\u00a0the \nrule of\u00a0law and the civic freedoms of\u00a0expression, association and assembly that are \nessential to\u00a0the realization of\u00a0all human rights, to\u00a0good governance and accountable \ninstitutions.2 A\u00a0healthy \u2018civil society space\u2019 is\u00a0one in\u00a0which public decision-making \nis\u00a0transparent, and in\u00a0which non-governmental organizations (NGOs), human rights \ndefenders, the judiciary and the media can operate independently to\u00a0scrutinize \ngovernment and corporate power. These elements of\u00a0accountability are all critical \nto\u00a0stable, profitable and sustainable business environments in\u00a0which companies \nthrive and economies prosper. Progress on\u00a0issues such as\u00a0fair wages, equality and \ncombatting corruption is\u00a0intimately linked to\u00a0full respect for the rule of\u00a0law and civic \nfreedoms, in\u00a0which shareholders and all stakeholders should recognize a\u00a0shared \ninterest. Yet, the crucial relationship between investors and civic freedoms remains \na\u00a0relative blind spot.3\nInvestors therefore need to\u00a0adopt a\u00a0more comprehensive approach to\u00a0environmental, \nsocial and governance (ESG) issues that recognizes the importance of\u00a0the rule ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The legislation is framed \naround restricting the use of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment \ncriteria, such as the safety and treatment of employees, the diversity of management \nand workforce, and readiness to withstand the impacts of climate change. Were they to \nbecome law, the inevitable result of the bills would be to manipulate the market to favor \nselect industries, particularly the volatile fossil fuel and firearms sectors. \nThis coordinated legislative effort, commonly referred to as the anti-ESG movement, \ngenerated massive backlash from the business community, labor leaders, retirees, and \neven Republican politicians. It is not an issue that resonates with the public. Despite \nall the hype, the vast majority of anti-ESG bills failed to progress through legislative \nchambers, including in ten states fully controlled by Republicans. At present, 21 laws \nand 6 resolutions in 16 states have made it through legislatures this year. Many of the \nfinalized bills were heavily amended to reduce most of the substantive portions. Broad \nescape clauses were added to limit the most draconian prohibitions, which experts have \nwarned legally contravene the basic tenets of fiduciary duty, creating a \u201cliability trap.\u201d\nThis report is the first comprehensive look at this legislative campaign and the broad \neffort to counter it. It follows the general arc of these 165 bills \u2014 where they came from, \nwho sponsored them, who supported and opposed them, and how they fared. \nAs of June, 2023, our tracking has concluded that:\n\u2022\t At least 165 distinct bills (including 9 resolutions) were introduced in 37 states.\n\u2022\t 83 bills are dead, across 23 states:\n\u2022\t In 17 states where legislation was introduced, no laws passed. 10 of these \nstates are controlled by Republicans.\n\u2022\t 3 bills were vetoed by the governor in Arizona. \n\u2022\t 42 bills that did not pass will carry over into the 2024 legislative session.\n\u2022\t 22 bills and 6 resolutions were approved by state governments:\n\u2022\t 19 laws and 6 resolutions have passed in 14 states this year.\n\u2022\t 3 enrolled bills await governor action in 3 states.\n\u2022\t 12 active bills are pending. 6 have not had committee hearings. \nCheck out our spreadsheet of all of the anti-ESG bills we tracked in 2023.  \nEach bill is categorized, and traced to specific model legislation, when relevant.\n\n2023 STATEHOUSE REPORT\nP 4\nIn this report, we map the coordinated special interest groups that crafted model bills \nand lobbied for their introduction. We showcase the exceptionally diverse opposition \nto the bills, including the bankers, businesses, financial officers, labor advocates, and \nenvironmentalists who saw the campaign as an attack on the American economy \nitself. We also provide the first comprehensive analysis of the types of bills introduced, \noffering a taxonomy of bills, so that readers can understand the tactical options \nattempted by Republican legislators.\nIt is safe to assume that the interest groups behind this legislative push are revising \ntheir strategies by evaluating the success and failure of the bills so that new versions \ncan be introduced across the country in 2024. To anticipate where this effort may \ngo next, we find it critical to understand\u00a0the network of actors behind this legislative \npush, the specific types of bills they proposed, and the ways they were received in the \nstates. \nDelaying Climate Accounting \u2014\u00a0and Action   \nThe climate crisis presents material financial risks across sectors and is increasingly \nrecognized by investors, executives, and regulators as a key threat to econom", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Our \ncommitment and the work we do in these areas align with \nour history of innovation and customer focus, as well as \nwith our company purpose to make a positive difference \nin the spaces where we live, work, learn, heal and play.\nThe last several years have demonstrated that the need \nfor healthy indoor environments has never been greater. \nAt Armstrong, we understand that the ceilings and walls that \nsurround us are essential links to our health and well-being. With \npeople spending nearly 90% of their time indoors, we believe it \nis more important than ever to shape this experience positively. \nTogether, the three pillars of our sustainability program\u2014\nProduct, Planet and People\u2014help us identify and address \nthe challenges and opportunities ahead. In this 2023 report, \nwe update our progress within the pillars toward our 2030 \ntargets and highlight key initiatives and achievements.\nOur commitment to sustainability means working to minimize \nthe impacts of the built environment to our existing natural \nworld. Given that nearly 40% of global emissions come from \nbuildings, our goals prioritize the protection of the environment \nfor future generations. This includes our 2030 greenhouse \ngas (GHG) reduction targets that the Science Based Target \nInitiative (SBTi) approved in 2022. We are also making \ninvestments throughout our operations to increase efficiency \nand reduce reliance on nonrenewable resources. As of the \nend of 2022, we had reduced our carbon footprint by 13% \nfrom 2019 levels and increased our use of renewable \nelectricity to 13% of total usage. \nWe are also investing in sustainable and circular design \npractices to reduce the environmental impact of the products \nand solutions we provide. By reducing our reliance on finite \nresources, minimizing waste and pollution, and designing \nresilient infrastructure that can adapt to our planet\u2019s changing \nneeds, we have the potential to meaningfully contribute \nto the shift from a linear economy to a circular economy. \nWe continue to pursue increased product transparency \nand to expand our SUSTAIN\u00ae portfolio of products that meet \nthe industry\u2019s most stringent sustainability criteria. We are \nalso proud of our long-standing Ceilings Recycling Program. \nSince 1999, we have diverted over 1.2 million tons of virgin raw \nmaterial from landfills. We continue to drive circularity in our \noperations, with customers and throughout our value chain. \nWe are also innovating to support greater building efficiency. \nA key highlight is the development of an energy-saving \nsystem that combines the DynaMax\u00ae grid systems for data \ncenters with our ULTIMA\u00ae AIRASSURE\u00ae gasketed ceiling. In \n2022, we validated that these systems installed in data center \nenvironments can deliver energy savings of up to 40 cents \nper square foot each year. With the average data center being \n100,000 square feet and reaching 1 million square feet for \nmega centers, the magnitude of savings is significant.  \nWe also know that healthy spaces and healthy communities \ngo hand in hand. Our commitment to health and safety begins \nwithin our own walls and extends to the communities we serve. \nBy ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Renewable energy \ninvestment now clearly exceeds fossil fuel investment, while the electrification of energy users is spreading. We still expect \nworld fossil fuel consumption to peak in 2023. With both the supply of clean energy and the electrification taking off, the \npolicy focus will turn to controlling supply chains and securing access to key materials. \nSustainable Debt Market Update: Weakness extends into 2023 ................................................................................................ 9 \nSustainability-labelled debt issuance continues to drift lower. The first four months of 2023 saw sustainable debt issuance \ndecline to USD 450bn, down from 543bn the same period last year. Similarly, flows into SRI/ESG-labelled funds for both \nbonds and equities have thus levelled off over the past 18 months. Both weaknesses are mostly due to a sudden drop in the \nUS sustainable loan market and the country\u2019s political conflict about ESG investing. Green bonds continue to increase \nglobally and in Europe, where ESG is less politically embattled, fund flows continue to support the demand side. \nDevelopment of the Nordic BECCS Market ..................................................................................................................................... 12 \nThe Nordic region is uniquely placed to be a major source of high-quality carbon removals for the burgeoning voluntary \ncarbon market. Aker Carbon Capture is working with biogenic CO2 emitters across the region on large scale carbon \nremovals projects. However, lack of clarity around interpretations of Paris Agreement Article 6 is leading to uncertainty on \nthe buy and supply side. A unified understanding on the principles of carbon removal accounting towards national NDCs \nand corporate Net-Zero strategies is paramount.   \nCarbon removal in aviation ................................................................................................................................................................. 15 \nAirbus is fully committed to contributing to reaching the net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 target set by the aviation \nindustry. To reach this target, carbon removal technologies, together with hydrogen, are promising complementary \nsolutions to biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel. As carbon removal becomes increasingly commoditized, it is essential \nthat a robust, liquid, and transparent market is established to ensure its effectiveness.   \nEU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: An overview of the EU\u2019s \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d.................................................. 18 \nThe EU\u2019s new Carbon Boarder Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) aims to reduce the competitive disadvantage faced by EU \nindustries subject to stringent emissions regulations. From 2026, importers of cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, \nelectricity, and hydrogen into the EU will have to pay the equivalent price of the EU ETS system.

Main events of half-year ended 30 September 2023  \n \n1.1. Trigger event assessment for assets impairment test  \n \nAlstom disclosed preliminary financial information for its first half of fiscal year 2023/24, ending September 30 2023, \nas well as an updated guidance regarding the full year 2023/24 (as disclosed in the press release dated 4 October \n2023). Following this announcement, Alstom\u2019s share price has significantly decreased, leading to a market \ncapitalization lower than the carrying amount of Alstom\u2019s net assets. As per IAS 36, this situation has been considered \nas a trigger event to reperform impairment test on goodwill (detailed in Note 11.1). The impairment test confirmed \nthat the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value at 30 September 2023, therefore no impairment loss was \nrecognized on Goodwill over the period. \nOn other assets: technology and other intangible assets (amortised assets), as well as deferred taxes (see Note 8), \nimpairment tests are reviewed at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that they might be \nimpaired. Based on its reasonable estimates, the visibility available and previous enlarged sensitivity analyses \nperformed in March 2023, Alstom has not identified any trigger event indicating that any assets should be impaired at \nthe end of September 2023. \n \n1.2. Uncertainties linked to the current economic and political context \n \nThe current economic and political context creates uncertainties on business activities (namely inflation, price volatility \nof certain commodities, energy, increases of interest rates, supply chain disruptions or electronic components \nshortage\u2026). Nevertheless, the Group carefully follows and monitors the potential increase in its cost structures (raw \nmaterials prices, supply chain and wages inflation), being quite well protected (73% of the backlog being covered by \nprice escalation clauses on global inflation - commodities, energy and labour indexes). \n \n1.3. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible \n \nMore than ever, decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom\u2019s strategy. The Group is reducing its own direct and indirect \nemissions (Scope 1 & 2) and is also committed to work with suppliers and customers (Scope 3) to contribute to Net \nZero carbon in the mobility sector. Alstom CO2 emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 \nby the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement \ncommitments.  \nThe supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase \nAgreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a \n10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom\u2019s electricity consumption in Europe, so this is \na major step in reaching our target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables. \nAlstom\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group \nmaintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the 3rd consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to \nECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency. Those results reflect its strong \nposition and strategy on Sustainability. \n\n \n \n\uf020\n \n5 \n \n1.4.

The ESG \nindicators also show that the six GCC countries, all of which are \noil-producing nations, are serious and committed in their efforts \ntowards fostering and integrating green and sustainable economy, \nand suggest that the direction of travel in the region may be towards \nfurther harmonization of sustainability-related regulations. \nThis alert memorandum briefly summarises the structure and \npurpose of the GCC\u2019s new ESG disclosure guidance, and places \nthem in the wider context of global emerging regulations on ESG \ndisclosures for listed companies.  \nIf you have any questions concerning \nthis memorandum, please reach out to \nyour regular firm contact or the \nfollowing authors \n \nABU DH ABI  \nChris Macbeth \n+971 2 412 1730 \ncmacbeth@cgsh.com \nLynn Ammar \n+971 2 412 1714 \nlammar@cgsh.com  \nMisthura Otubu \n+971 2 412 1813 \nmotubu@cgsh.com \nHiba Younes \n+971 2 412 1712 \nhyounes@cgsh.com  \nRO ME  \nClara Cibrario Assereto \n+39 06 6952 2225 \nccibrarioassereto@cgsh.com \n \n\nALERT  ME MO RA ND U M  \n \n2\nI. \nThe GCC\u2019s unified ESG disclosure \nguidance \nUnified GCC sustainability disclosure guidance \nOn January 9, 2023, the Exchanges Committee of the \nGCC launched a set of unified sustainability disclosure \nindicators, which may be adopted by all listed \ncompanies across the region.   \nThe new guidance creates ESG indicators across all \n3 pillars of sustainability: Environment (e.g. GHG \nemissions and climate risk mitigation), Social (e.g. \nchild labor and global health), and Governance (e.g. \nboard diversity and sustainability reporting). They \ncomprise 29 indicators aligned with the World \nFederation of Exchanges (\u201cWFE\u201d) and Sustainable \nStock Exchanges (\u201cSSE\u201d) Initiative. Please refer to the \ntable below for a full list of the ESG indicators and \ntheir corresponding calculations.  \nThe WFE operates as the global industry association \nfor exchanges and clearing houses worldwide. \nMembers of the WFE include the Abu Dhabi \nSecurities Exchange (\u201cADX\u201d), Dubai Financial \nMarket (\u201cDFM\u201d), as well as other stock exchanges in \nthe GCC region. The SSE on the other hand provides \nan avenue for examining how exchanges and relevant \nstakeholders (such as listed companies, investors, and \nregulators) can boost corporate transparency, enhance \nESG initiatives, and encourage sustainable investment.  \nThe GCC indicators are mapped against the Global \nReporting Initiative (\u201cGRI\u201d)\u2019s sector-agnostic general \nstandards. The GRI, an international, not-for-profit \norganization, has developed a set of guidelines that are \nused by thousands of corporate and public sector \nreporting entities in over 90 countries. \nPre-existing local sustainability disclosure regimes \nStock exchanges in the Gulf region adopted their own \nindividual sustainability disclosure standards prior to \nthe implementation of the unified guidance.  \n \n1 Our alert memorandum on the proposed ADGM \nsustainable finance regulatory framework is accessible here. \nOnce in place, the framework will amend (among others) \nIn the United Arab Emirates (\u201cUAE\u201d), each of the \nthree stock exchanges (the ADX, DFM, and Nasdaq \nDubai) has its own voluntary ESG disclosure \nguidance. On the regulatory front, financial free zones \nsuch as the Abu Dhabi Global Market (the \u201cADGM\u201d) \nhave also proposed their own disclosure guidance. 1  \nAlthough the GCC\u2019s new indicators are neither a \ncomprehensive reporting framework nor a replacement \nfor the existing disclosure standards, they should \nfacilitate uniformity in ESG reporting by listed \ncompanies all across the region.  \nWhilst the Exchanges Committee is not a regulator, the \nnew unified ESG guidance are an indicator t", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

For \nexample, one of our ambitious sustainability goals \nis to generate all the energy to power \u0160KODA \nAUTO\u2019s\u00a0 vehicle and component production \nplants in the Czech Republic with net-zero carbon \nemissions in the second half of this decade.\nAnd we are well on our way: the Vrchlab\u00ed \nplant has been our first CO2 -neutral production \nfacility since the end of 2020 thanks to the use \nof alternative energies. Moreover, as of this year, \nnatural gas is gradually being replaced by CO2-\nneutral methane from biogas plants. And since \n2019, \u0160KODA AUTO has not sent any waste \noriginating from our production processes to \nlandfills thanks to our endeavours to prevent \nwaste generation and to use raw material \nresources sparingly.\nFor us at \u0160KODA AUTO, sustainability means \nmuch more than just taking care of our planet. \nEspecially in these challenging times, we realise \nhow important it is to actively help out in society: \nAlready during the first lockdown in the spring of \n2020, we made sure that COVID volunteers had \naccess to mobility \u2013 100 OCTAVIA COMBIs were \ndonated to social and medical aid services, and \nmore than 200 cars and electric scooters from \nour sharing platforms HoppyGo and BeRider \nwere made available free of charge.\nApart from the fast pandemic aid, we provide \nlong-term support to society in many areas: With \nour \u0160KODA Endowment Fund, we sustainably \nimprove the quality of life in the regions around \nour Czech plants. We are investing a\u00a0 total  \nof 30 million Euros in the areas of transport, sport \nand culture, urban development and safety.\nFurthermore, we are also committed to \nmaking rapid and sustainable progress on  \nthe topic of diversity. In 2019, \u0160KODA AUTO \nsigned the European Diversity Charter and joined \nmore than 12,000 signatories in Europe. In 2020, \nwe became a\u00a0Golden Signatory of the Diversity \nCharter in the Czech Republic alongside over 90 \ncompanies promoting diversity and inclusion.\n\u0160KODA AUTO wants to emerge as a\u00a0winner \nfrom the automotive industry\u2019s\u00a0 ongoing \ntransformation process. Not only in terms of \nour KPIs, but in all areas of our company. This is \nour goal; this is our responsibility.\nBest wishes, \nThomas Sch\u00e4fer \nCEO \u0160KODA AUTO a.s.\n\n1.\u2003\nIntroduction\u2003\n\u2003\n\u2003\n1.2\u2003\n\u0160KODA AUTO Helps\n4\nContent \u2192\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the state of \nemergency declared in the Czech Republic were \na\u00a0completely new experience in the field of public-\nprivate partnerships. Even though the crisis hit \nthe entire automotive industry significantly,  \nthe company\u2018s\u00a0management decided not to \nstand aside and contributed to the prevention \nand resolution of the sudden situation, both \nfinancially and by providing its own human  \nand material resources.\nIn March 2020, in response to the development \nof the pandemic, \u0160KODA AUTO in cooperation \nwith \u0160KODA AUTO DigiLab launched an initiative \nunder the motto #SKODAAUTOpomaha (meaning \n#\u0160KODAAUTOhelps) to support mobility  \nand key stakeholders in its immediate vicinity. \nThe carmaker thus responded very quickly to \nthe acute need for mobility for the distribution \nof food and medicine by non-profit organisations \nand city districts, which provided supplies to \nthe elderly and disabled. The platform thus \nenabled the immediate rental of the existing \nHoppyGo and Uniqway fleet within hours \nof the declaration of a\u00a0 sta", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

This inertia is driving \nthe transformation of all economic sectors, especially the industrial sectors, where the \nchange in the energy mix plays a crucial role. \nIf we look at the industries to which Gonvarri\u2019s activity has traditionally been linked, \nthe impact of this transformation is global and intense. The automotive industry is \nmoving unstoppable toward electrification and mobility services; steel production is \nseeing growing interest in low-emission steel, as it prepares for a true \u201cGreen Steel\u201d \nrevolution. In relation to renewables, the current context of war between Ukraine and \nRussia, where the renewed interest of many European countries in reducing their \ndependence on Russian-origin natural gas is leading them to review their energy \nand security of supply policies by setting new and more ambitious renewable energy \ntargets for 2030, is a major conditioning factor.\nLetter from the Chairman\nJon Riberas\nenvironmental protection, climate \nchange action and social equity \nare essential elements in the \ntransformation toward a low-carbon \nand resource-efficient economy\n102-14\nGonvarri\nEnvironmental\nSocial\nGovernment\nValue creation and sustainable management. Drive Model\nLetter from the CEO\nMateriality\nThe Company\nLetter from the Chairman\nESG CULTURE\nANNEX\ni\nLetter from the Chairman\n3\nGonvarri Industries  Sustainability Report 2021\n\nFrom a risk perspective, climate risk represents a structural and long-term risk that \ncauses capital reallocation. The profitability of business must be sustainable over \ntime, and in the future we see that regulatory restrictions, financial markets and \nsociety in general are designing new very restrictive boundary conditions with CO2 \nemissions. This is why the consolidation of our Carbon-Neutral Plan is a strategic \npriority for the coming years, which has also led us to commit to the Science Based \nTargets initiative and its Net-Zero framework, which establishes the highest level of \nambition in the reduction of CO2 emissions. \nTaking advantage of the opportunities offered by this energy transition will help \nus to: reduce the environmental impact of our energy consumption, limit our \ndependence on non-native energy resources and explore new business areas linked \nto this new economy. The green economy poses changes in the production and \nconsumption models, and to the extent that we can anticipate these changes, we \nwill take advantage of the opportunities that this transition offers us.\nAt Gonvarri, 2021 also marked a change in the Strategic Plan. The Plan for the 2019-\n2021 period has already been defined as one of its pillars the drive for growth and \ndiversification of technological and innovative projects in markets with development \npotential. This pillar is still present in the new 22-24 Strategic Plan that, with the \nalways fundamental reference of the Sustainability Policy, which helps us become \naware of the challenges facing society, are the guide that directs our decisions and \nactions. \nIn this context, I present once again this year\u2019s Sustainability Report for the 2021 \nfinancial year, where we renew and maintain our commitment to the Global Compact, \npromoting compliance with the 10 Universal Principles and aligned with the \nSustainable Development Goals. \nFinally, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the work and dedication of those \npeople who make it possible for Gonvarri to continue to advance steadily in its \nbusiness project. Honesty, humility, tenacity and hard work have always been our \nhallmark and our best guarantee of a job well done. \nI invite you to take a closer look at our report and learn in detail about our progress \non environmental, social and governance issues. \nThank you very much\nThe green economy poses changes in the production and consumption models, and to the extent that we can \nanticipate these changes, we will take advantage of the opportunities that this transition offers us.\nGonvarri\nEnvironmental\nSocial\nGovernment\nValue creation and sustainable management.

According to the latest Carbon \nDisclosure Project (CDP) report, data disclosed by the majority of the operators indicate \nthat a significant portion of emissions are generated in the value chain. This is obviously \ngreater for the network operators that have managed to switch fully to renewable energy \nin their operations. These emissions are part of those termed \u2018scope 3\u2019 (a company\u2019s in- \ndirect emissions from its supply chain and from the use of its products by its customers) \naccording to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Sustainable supply chains should also \nbe guided by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, with \nenvironmental, economic, and social considerations incorporated into all of the supply \nchain operation areas. \nIn this publication, the key challenges mobile operators face in developing sustainable \nsupply chains are outlined. A review of the emerging regulatory and standards environ\u00ad\nment is conducted and approaches and best practices in developing sustainable supply \nchains are identified by relating the emerging business and regulatory environment to \nexamples of the changes that operators and their supply chain partners may need to \nmake both at a strategic and operational level. The key conclusion is: Integrating sustai\u00ad\nnability goals into the operator\u2019s core objectives is of key importance as well as selecting \nsuppliers whose own sustainability strategies are aligned with these goals.\nFinally, a practical checklist (Annex A) based on the best practices in the industry is provided \nto support operators in developing a sustainable procurement strategy. Examples from \nacross the industry are included that highlight that companies are already embracing \nmany of the concepts identified in this report. \n\n5\nCONTENTS\n01\n06\n02\n07\n03\n08\n04\n09\n05\n10\nINTRODUCTION.................................................. 6-7\nCONCLUSIONS...............................................  20-21\nSUSTAINABLE SUPPLY \nCHAIN CHALLENGES...................................... 8-9\nANNEX A: \nGUIDE FOR TELCOS TO PROCURE \nSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS................ 22-23\nSUPPLY CHAIN \nEMISSIONS REDUCTION \nLEVERS FOR TELCOS.................................10-11\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.............................24\nSUPPLY CHAIN REGULATORY \nENVIRONMENT..............................................12-13\nREFERENCES................................................................25\nCRITICAL SUCCESS \nFACTORS FOR SUPPLY CHAIN \nSUSTAINABILITY...........................................14-19\nBEST PRACTICES.....................................................26\n5.1 Developing ESG goals.............................................14\n5.2 Strategy and aligning with ESG goals.............15\n5.3 New Processes............................................................15\n5.3.1 Supply Chain Management \nand Procurements............................................................16\n5.3.2 Product / Service Development / \nDevices....................................................................................16\n5.3.3 Marketing and Communications..................18\n5.3.4 Logistics......................................................................18\n5.3.5 People and Human Resources......................19\n5.3.6 Networks...................................................", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The switch from a linear, throwaway society to a circular \neconomy in which resources are no longer wasted is an absolute pri-\nority. Now, for the second time, we share news of key progress made \nand the challenges we face in the FREITAG Impact Report. It provides \ninsights into how we align our overall strategic goals, projects and \ndaily work with our overarching purpose: \u00abIntelligent design for a cir-\ncular future\u00bb.\nThe year 2022 was marked by political events worldwide and the en-\nsuing economic instability. On a human level, the war in Ukraine has \nhad massive repercussions. We thus made a snap decision to use a \nsubstantial portion of the \u00abFREITAG Nonprofit Fund\u00bb for charitable \npurposes in support of emergency humanitarian aid in Ukraine. On a \nbusiness level, the rising costs caused by the war presented us with \nchallenges along the entire value chain. Apart from this, it is becom-\ning increasingly difficult to source discarded truck tarps of suitable \nquality. At the same time, we were faced with the aftermath of the \nCorona pandemic and China\u2019s zero-Covid policy, which was still caus-\ning supply shortages and, consequently, delivery delays in our supply \nchain. \nFREITAG has been aware of its corporate responsibility since its \nfoundation and today unwaveringly focuses on striking a balance \nbetween people, planet and profitability. Internally, we have creat-\ned a code of conduct for the F-Crew with the \u00abCulture Code\u00bb and \nlaunched several formats to strengthen the resilience and mental \nhealth of all FREITAG employees. In 2022, to make our supply chain \neven more transparent, we intensified the partnership-based dia-\nlogue with our long-standing producers and identified joint fields of \naction.\nWe were equally concerned with the importance and urgency of cli-\nmate change and the need for substantial emissions reductions. \nFREITAG has therefore committed to company-wide emissions re-\nductions that are in line with the scientifically based 1.5\u00b0C targets. To \nthis end, we have developed a roadmap and had our near-term emis-\nsions target by 2030 verified in accordance with the net-zero stand-\nards defined by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). At prod-\nuct and service level we have addressed the challenges of resource \nscarcity: Our innovative circular truck tarp project has resulted in two \nprototypes of the tarp of the future going on a first road test. With the \nCIRC-CASE smartphone protector, we have introduced our first circu-\nlar product with an accompanying take-back system.\nIn 2022, FREITAG took the principle of self-organization a step fur-\nther. Previously, formal responsibility for managing the outermost cir-\ncle of the company was on the shoulders of a single individual. This \ncentral position is now jointly handled by a collegial management \ncollective. This entrepreneurial and strategically thinking collective \nhas since developed a long-term corporate strategy that addresses \nand underpins the five ambitions outlined in the \u00abFREITAG Circularity \nRoadmap\u00bb, our sustainability strategy.\nHowever, FREITAG cannot achieve these circular ambitions alone. To \ndo so, we need partnerships that help us create recyclable materials \nand customers who value our products and extend their life by mak-\ning use of our circular services.

ESG requirements applicable to\nBelgian companies are continuously evolving and increasingly include sanctions for non-compliance, targeting\ncompanies and their directors.\nCase law. National courts in Europe are also developing influential transnational case law, holding companies\nliable for harms to human rights and the environment caused by their activities. In ground-breaking cases in the\nNetherlands and the UK, courts have ruled that an EU-based parent company can be held accountable towards\nclaimants residing outside of the EU for breach of a duty of care by its foreign subsidiary. Laws comparable to\nthose on which these courts relied apply in Belgium.

The reality is profoundly different: \ngrowing scientific evidence shows that the health of the sea is strongly at \nrisk and that marine ecosystems are already subject to extreme stress due \nto over-exploitation of natural resources, reduction of biodiversity, acidifica-\ntion and pollution. This is a serious and complex problem, since the conser-\nvation of the ocean is fundamental for our health and well-being. \nThe ocean and the sea are a source of natural resources and eco-system \nservices. They provide us with several irreplaceable benefits such as har-\nvestable goods (e.g. fish, shellfish, seaweed), regulating services (e.g. atmo-\nspheric heat absorption and redistribution, climate regulation), supporting ser-\nvices (e.g. oxygen generation 2.5 times greater than that of the Amazon rain-\nforest), as well as cultural services (e.g. recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual \nbenefits), and they are crucial to address many of the global challenges of \nthe coming decades, such as food security, climate change and clean energy \ngeneration. Therefore, the conservation of marine and coastal ecosystems is \npart of the UN Agenda 2030 directly addressed in Sustainable Development \nGoal (SDG) 14, Life below water, but it is also linked to the other SDGs.\nThe value of the \u201cocean economy\u201d is comparable to the GDP of coun-\ntries such as UK or Italy. The sectors involved include consolidated indus-\ntrial activities and services such as maritime and coastal tourism, commer-\ncial fishing and fish processing, industrial aquaculture, shipbuilding and ship \nmaintenance, offshore oil and gas extraction, port activities, shipping and mar-\nitime trade. Moreover, emerging sectors, such as the exploitation of renew-\nable energy (e.g. generated by waves, tides, algae, offshore wind), indus-\ntrial aquaculture in open marine environments, or the use of marine biodiver-\nsity, yet to be mapped, for medical-pharmaceutical purposes, are destined to \nassume greater importance in the near future. Some of these sectors have \nexperienced exponential growth in the last decade.\nThis environmental and economic wealth is threatened by direct and indi-\nrect pressures exerted by production and consumption activities. Indeed, sci-\nentific research suggests that the pressures generated by land-based indus-\ntries exceed those directly operating on the ocean. This means that the pos-\nsibility of increasing the sustainability of marine and coastal ecosystems \ndepends to a large extent on the involvement and engagement of many dif-\nferent sectors and stakeholders. But more specifically, it depends on the \nengagement of industries that - only apparently - seem to have a minor impact \non the health of our seas. This is about building awareness, diffusing knowl-\nedge, and identifying possible solutions with regard to the protection of the \nocean, similarly to the global efforts deployed to tackle climate change over \nthe last two decades. \n\nBUSINESS FOR OCEAN SUSTAINABILITY     5 \nIn fact, the mission of the One Ocean Foundation is to accelerate solu-\ntions to ocean issues by inspiring leaders, promoting the sustainable blue \neconomy and enhancing knowledge through ocean literacy. I would like to \npersonally express my gratitude to our partners, CSIC, McKinsey & Company \nand SDA Bocconi School of Management who assisted us all the way from \nthe initial definitions of this study through to the execution.  \nThis publication comes at an important time. We will give you insights \ninto the current business understanding of ocean risks and challenges and \nwe will provide a first overview of the many technologies and organizational \ninnovations that can be leveraged to reduce the pressures we are exerting \non the seas and the marine environment. \nWe decided to focus this research on the Mediterranean Sea and on \ncompanies operating mainly in this sensitive social-ecological area: due to \nits unique biodiversity, natural resources, restricted communication with the \nopen ocean, high anthropization and industrialization of its coasts, in fact, the \nMediterranean Sea is even more vulnerable to external pressures than other \nmarine ecosystems. We believe that this ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

On the one hand, we \nare making a significant contribution to supplying patients with proven \nmedicines as a trusted partner and, on the other hand, we have intro-\nduced many new products. The underlying conditions for our business \nare challenging. But despite ongoing geopolitical and macro\u00adeconomic \nturbulence, STADA was able to grow continuously in all three product \nsegments and in all important regions in the first six months of 2023. \nOver the past five years, we have transformed STADA from a generics \nmanufacturer to also offer consumer healthcare products  \nand specialty pharmaceuticals. And this path is paying off: both in  \nthe generics arena and in consumer healthcare, we continue to be \nnumber\u00a04 in Europe. In our important market of Germany, we even \nsucceeded in overtaking Bayer Consumer with our two companies \nSTADA and ALIUD to become number 1. \n \nThere are a variety of activities behind this pleasing development. Our \nrecipe for success is to focus continuously on Consumer Healthcare, \nGenerics and Specialty, and to realize synergies. However, our impres-\nsive growth course is primarily driven by our unique corporate culture, \nin which around 14,000 employees worldwide work together as  \nOne STADA to achieve a single overriding goal: \u201cCaring for People\u2019s \nHealth as a Trusted Partner\u201d. Especially in challenging times, it is par-\nticularly important to have this clarity about our purpose and values. \nThat is why I am very pleased with the results of our latest global \nemployee survey, conducted in May this year.\nOutstandingly, 88% of our colleagues took the time to participate in \nthe survey, which shows how engaged employees are across all func-\ntions and regions within the company. It is clear from the survey how \nimportant it is to us at STADA to always act with integrity. We always \nwant to provide the best service, whether working with patients,  \ndoctors, nurses, pharmacists, PTAs, wholesalers or suppliers. Our  \nSTADA \u2013 \nCaring for \nPeople\u2019s \nHealth\nPeter Goldschmidt\nCEO\n\nemployees take an above-average degree of pride in working for STADA, and our workforce demon-\nstrates a deep conviction that we will achieve our business goals.\n \nOur employees\u2019 pride and confidence are based on our ability to deliver the right product to the right \nplace at the right time, on a consistent basis. Here, I would particularly like to highlight the perfor-\nmance of our approximately 7,000 colleagues who work in Technical Operations around the world. \nAs a One STADA Team, we ensure that we maintain drug safety in the best possible way. For example, \nin the first half of 2023, we increased our internal production by around 15% to ensure that we have \nsufficient stocks. At the same time, we continued to work with thousands of trusted external partners \nto improve security of supply and address medicines shortages.\nIn the first six months of the current financial year, STADA achieved important milestones in \n\u00adsupporting patients\u2019 access to the medicines they need. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \napproved the delivery of the biological drug epoetin from a facility in Uetersen, Germany, to the USA, \nthus opening up an additional opportunity to expand our growth. Almost simultaneously, the author-\nities in the EU confirmed that our plant in Tuy H\u00f2a, Vietnam, meets European GMP (Good Manufac-\nturing Practice) standards. This means that in the future we will also be able to produce in Vietnam \nfor Europe. Construction work on our supply chain hub in Turda, Romania, is progressing according \nto plan. This investment of more than \u20ac\u00a050\u00a0million will add significant capacity to our supply network \nin Europe.\nWith initiatives such as photovoltaic cells in Vietnam and industry-leading design concepts in Turda, \nSTADA continues to advance its contribution to sustainable pharmaceutical supply. Within the Group, \nwe are pursuing a global sustainability policy. To this end, we are currently preparing the publication \nof our second STADA Global Sustainability Report in the third \u00adquarter of this year, which will provide \ninsight into our numerous environmental, social and governance initiatives around the world. We are \nalso among the leading pharmaceutical companies in the world in terms of ESG.\nAll these factors contributed to STADA\u2019s continuation of its growth journey in the first half of 2023. \nAt Group level, adjusted sales increased by 16% to \u20ac\u00a02.06\u00a0billion, while adjusted earnings before \ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) improved by 30% to \u20ac\u00a0509\u00a0million. For the \nfirst time in the company\u2019s history, we expect to take our EBITDA to more than one billion euros in \n2023. STADA is thus also in an excellent position compared to its \u00adcompetitors and is growing signifi-\ncantly stronger in terms of sales and pr", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The practical approach helps \nboard members and business leaders to assess their \neffectiveness in achieving long-term sustainability.  \nGovernments, investors and directors are all placing \nincreasing focus on sustainability. As a consequence, \nthere is a heightened emphasis on the relationship \nbetween environmental, social and governance \n(ESG) issues, particulalry in Europe. This triggered \nthe development of our practical guide which \nresonates with ecoDa\u2019s recent publication, \u2018Five \nCorporate Governance guidelines to accelerate \nchange and sustainable growth in Europe\u2019, which \noutlines good practice already implemented in \nsome European countries, conducive of sustainable \nsuccess and economic growth.\nOne of the guidelines is \u2018to commit to ESG as a \ndifferentiating strategic competitive advantage \nfor longer-term sustainable value creation\u2019. This \nview is also reflected in our joint guide which steers \nboards away from approaching sustainability as an \nadd on, tick-boxing compliance exercise or a mere \nmarketing-driven initiative. \nBoth publications complement each other on the \nsteps board members should take to embed ESG \nvalue drivers into sustainable business models. \nWhile the Guidelines focus on best practices \nconducive to sustainable and profitable growth, this \nGuide elaborates on how to implement them in \na systematic way while taking a forward-looking \napproach to setting clear next steps and objectives.\nMazars\n2\nLeena Linnainmaa\nChair of ecoDa and \nSecretary General of the \nDirector\u2019s Institute Finland\nGareth Jones\nGlobal Head of Privately Owned \nBusiness at Mazars\n\nA practical guide for boards and leadership teams on sustainability\nMazars\n3\n\nA practical guide for boards and leadership teams on sustainability\nIntroduction\nCommit, think and act \nThe contribution of business to society in \na changing world \nBusinesses are the engine of wealth creation and \nplay a vital role in building a healthy and prosperous \nsociety. There has been concern that, in some \ninstances, too great an emphasis has been placed \non short-term profit maximisation at the expense \nof a more balanced focus on long-term, sustainable \nsuccess1.  With four-fifths of the market value \nof leading businesses now centred on people, \nrelationship-based assets and other intangibles, the \nbusiness community will benefit from expanding \nits view of success. When focusing on wealth \ncreation boards and leadership teams must build \nlasting value simultaneously for businesses, their \nshareholders, other stakeholders and wider society.\nMoreover, with employees, customers, investors, \nfinance providers, governments and the media all \nhighlighting the importance of sustainability, the \nthreat to the ongoing viability of businesses if \nboards fail to address ESG issues effectively is \nsubstantially increasing.\nHow boards and leadership teams can \ncontribute to sustainability \nBoards and leadership teams can manifest their \nsupport for sustainability in a number of ways, \nincluding minimising their environmental footprint in \norder to mitigate the risk of climate change, adopting \nfair human rights  policies (for example, diversity \nand inclusion), offering secure employment at living \nwages,  treating their customers fairly, building \nethical and environmentally friendly supply chains \nand  transparent and balanced tax policies.\nAn approach based on commitment, \nthinking and action\nThe guide encourages b", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Introduction \n1.1. The Belgian Code on Corporate Governance \nThe corporate governance practices of Anheuser-Busch InBev are reflected in its Corporate Governance Charter,  \nwhich is available on https://www.ab-inbev.com/investors/corporate-governance/corporate-governance-documents.html. \nThe Charter is regularly updated. \nAnheuser-Busch InBev is a company incorporated under Belgian law with a primary listing on Euronext Brussels (Euronext: \nABI) and with secondary listings on the Mexico Stock Exchange (MEXBOL: ANB) and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange \n(JSE: ANH) (ISIN: BE0974293251) and with American Depositary Shares (\u201cADSs\u201d) listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \nAs a Belgian company with a primary listing on Euronext Brussels, Anheuser-Busch InBev adheres to the principles and \nprovisions of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code (www.corporategovernancecommittee.be) (\u201cthe Corporate \nGovernance Code\u201d), taking into account its specific status as a multinational group with secondary listings in Mexico and \nJohannesburg and with ADSs listed in New York.  \nIn line with AB InBev\u2019s specific shareholding structure and the global nature of its operations, the company has departed in \n2022 from the following soft-law principles of the Corporate Governance Code: \nPrinciple 4.19 of the Corporate Governance Code: \u201cthe Board should set up a nomination committee with the \nmajority of its members comprising independent non-executive board members\u201d - The Board of Directors appoints \nthe chairman and members of the Nomination Committee from among the directors. As the committee is composed \nexclusively of non-executive directors who are independent of management and free from any business relationship that \ncould materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment, the Board considers that the composition of this \ncommittee achieves the aim of Principle 4.19 of the Corporate Governance Code. \nPrinciple 7.6 of the Corporate Governance Code: \u201cA non-executive board member should receive part of their \nremuneration in the form of shares in the company. These shares should be held until at least one year after the \nnon-executive board member leaves the board and at least three years after the moment of award. However, no \nstock options should be granted to non-executive board members\u201d - The share-based component of the directors\u2019 \nremuneration is paid in the form of Restricted Stock Units. Such Restricted Stock Units vest after five years and, upon \nvesting, entitle their holders to one AB InBev share per Restricted Stock Unit (subject to any applicable withholdings). The \nshares delivered to directors upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units are not subject to a lock-up of three years after the \ndate of delivery and one year after the date of departure of the relevant director. However, the Board considers that the five-\nyear vesting period of the Restricted Stock Units fosters a sustainable and long-term commitment of the directors to \nshareholder value creation that addresses the goal of Principle 7.6 of the Corporate Governance Code. \n1.2. New York Stock Exchange Listing \nFurther to the New York Stock Exchange listing of ADSs representing ordinary shares of AB InBev, the New York Stock \nExchange Corporate Governance rules for Foreign Private Issuers are applicable to the company. AB InBev has also \nregistered under the US Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, it is also subject to the US Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002 and to certain US Securities laws and regulations relating to corporate governance. \n1.3. Specific Corporate Governance initiatives \n1.3.1. FOSTERING ETHICAL CONDUCT \nThe Board of Directors and management of AB InBev are committed to promoting and maintaining the highest standards of \nethical behavior and transparency. This guides everything that AB InBev does as an organization, and serves as its \nfoundation for creating a future with more cheers.   \nAB InBev has established ethical rules and internal codes and policies to reinforce this commitment. The Code of Business \nConduct sets out the ethical standards which all colleagues around the world are expected to adhere to and provides \nguidance for interactions with third parties. It requires colleagues to comply with all applicable laws, disclose any relevant \nconflicts of interests, to act in the best interests of the company, and conduct all dealings in an honest and ethical manner. \nIt covers confidentiality of information, limits on offering or accepting gifts or entertainment, and the appropriate use of the \ncompany\u2019s property.

From the cost of capital, credit scores and insurance rates to \nhow shareholders vote, stakeholders demand engagement, transparency and investment-grade \nESG disclosure. Without question, the public health crisis and racial, social and civil unrest \nraised the stature of the \u201cS\u201d in ESG, prompting an expanded and more granular focus on how \nwe manage AEP\u2019s ESG performance, disclosure and governance. \nThe prominence of material sustainability issues in 2020 created an ESG trifecta: climate \nchange strategy, risks and management; human capital management, including diversity, equity \nand inclusion; and the resilience and management of a company\u2019s strategy and business model. \nAwareness of how ESG impacts the full value-chain helps to strengthen and inform business \ndecisions and strategies. ESG-informed decisions will be critical inputs as we reimagine a \nmodern, clean and reliable energy future for our customers; as we rebuild dynamic and thriving \neconomies; and as we develop a flexible, diverse and inclusive workforce for the future. \nResearch has proven that companies with strong ESG performance realize short- and long-term \nvalue through enhanced growth, reduced costs, improved stakeholder relationships, increased \nemployee satisfaction, and optimization of investment and capital expenditures. At AEP, we are \nintegrating our sustainability practices and ESG initiatives into our corporate strategies and \nsharing our progress and goals with all of our stakeholders. \n \n\nAEP\u2019s 2021 ESG Strategy & Performance Report \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n4 \n \nHow We Manage ESG for AEP \n\u2022 Maintain ongoing monitoring of ESG material issues \n\u2022 Engage third-party research organizations to ensure use of accurate and timely data \n\u2022 Tell our story by engaging our stakeholders \n\u2022 Be transparent about AEP\u2019s ESG performance \n\u2022 Integrate ESG into AEP\u2019s strategy and risk monitoring \n\u2022 \nPosition AEP as an industry and ESG/sustainability leader \n \nESG MATERIALITY \nThe evolution of corporate sustainability reporting and ESG disclosure has become more \ndetailed and complex as stakeholders demand deeper levels of transparency. We live in a \nhyper-transparent and data-driven world \u2013 where ESG was once seen as qualitative by nature \nbut is now becoming measureable \u2013 that drives demand for companies to enhance the quality, \ncomparability and usefulness of their ESG disclosure. \nMateriality matters when disclosing performance. We cannot address every issue, nor should \nwe. To most effectively manage our resources and focus on the material issues to our business \nand our stakeholders, we must focus on what is most relevant to our financial and nonfinancial \nsuccess. That is what our stakeholders expect of us and how we are best able to respond to \ntheir needs and concerns.

These two powerhouse \nleaders have been weaving sustainability \ninto company\u2019s culture. With our projects \nand initiatives, we\u2019re transforming Belgium\u2019s \ninsurance market leader into a shining example \nof a people- and planet-friendly organisation.\nWe give you an overview of AG\u2019s sustainability-\nrelated challenges and triumphs over the past \nyear, which you\u2019ll explore in greater detail in the \nfollowing pages. \n \n3\n2022 Sustainability Report\n\n\u201cMy mission is to embed \nsustainability in each \ndepartment of our company \u201d\nHow was 2022 for AG? \nHeidi Delobelle: 2022 was in many \nways an eventful year for our \ncustomers: the war in Ukraine, the \nunstable market, the energy crisis, \nincreasing prices and the drought \nthat lasted for several months. But \nour clients can find in AG a solid \ncompany run with a long term view, \ntoday but also tomorrow and the day \nafter tomorrow.\nWhat are your ambitions in terms \nof sustainability?\nH.D.: Sustainability is a major part \nof who we are. We want to embed \nit further in our day-to-day activi-\nties, by incorporating it in all of our \ncurrent and future projects. Our \nsustainability strategy is divided into \nfour key areas, covering our role as \nan insurer, investor, employer and \nbusiness. Our role as an investor is \nobvious. We have close to \u20ac70 billion \nassets under management including \na significant portion that can be \nearmarked for sustainable purposes. \nBut even more crucial is our role as \nan insurer. Incorporating sustaina-\nbility in the core of our activities is \nessential to building a sustainable \nfuture. I\u2019m delighted to see that \neach department at our company is \ninternalising this philosophy.\nDo you think young people have \nhigh expectations when it comes \nto sustainability? \nH.D.: Absolutely. After all, they know \nthat we\u2019ll be leaving the planet in \ntheir care in two, three or even four \ngenerations. We regularly check \nin with them by collaborating with \nschools and running activities that \nappeal to this target group. And \nthere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the \nfurther we go in the sustainability \ntransition, the more successful we\u2019ll \nbe in attracting young talent to join \nour ranks. Our brand new learning \nand innovation centre, the AG \nCampus, illustrates our sustainability \nambitions in so many ways and is \nthe go-to place to work collabora-\ntively, feel inspired and interact with \ncolleagues.\nHeidi Delobelle\nCEO\n> Back to contentpage\n4\n2022 Sustainability Report\n\nSustainability is often associated \nwith climate change, but is  \nthat it? \nNathalie Erdmanis: That\u2019s true, \nbecause climate change is a big \npiece of it and gets a lot of press \ncoverage.

Antolin today: A history of leadership\n1.1. \nConversation with the Chairman\n\t\u276fIn Grupo Antolin\u2019s last report, you summed up the 2020 \nfinancial year with two words: responsibility and solidarity. \nWhat words or what headline would you use to summarize \nGrupo Antolin\u2019s performance during 2021?\nThe 2021 financial year has been very complex for the entire industry as \na consequence of the global economic effects the pandemic has con-\ntinued to cause; the most significant being the disruption to the global \nsupply chain, but we should also not forget the inflationary pressure \nthrough raw materials and logistics. It is undoubtedly a challenging \nsituation, but the strength of large companies is being demonstrated at \nthis time and I believe that Grupo Antolin has been able to rise to the \noccasion. Thanks to our teams, who are the heart of our business, we \nhave once again shown our great capacity for adaptation, flexibility and \nefficiency in responding to this environment. \n\t\u276fA major milestone this year is approving the new \nenvironmental, social and governance objectives to continue \ndeveloping its sustainable business model. What has been \nconsidered when defining these and what does it mean for the \ncompany?\nThe approval of the new objectives is another very important step in \nour commitment to our activity helping in some way to build a fairer \nand better planet in all regards: environmental, ethical, respect for \nHuman Rights, development of talent in the new generations and \nmore. As companies we are not isolated entities, but rather key mem-\nbers of the society in which we live, so we have a big responsibility to \ncontribute to its development and well-being. This is even more true \nfor a company with the characteristics of ours, which is so diverse, with \nmany nationalities and operating in dozens of locations throughout \nErnesto Antolin\nChairman of Grupo Antolin\n26 countries; many in small towns where we are the leading employer. \nWith this conviction, the objectives seek to generate value in three \nmain areas \u2013Planet, People and Business\u2013 through specific and tangi-\nble initiatives, which have been being developed for years, but which \nwill now gain new momentum and strength. The framework for action \nfor all of this is the 2030 Agenda, its associated objectives and goals, \nand the 10 Principles of the Global Compact to which we have been \nfully committed since 2004.\n \n\t\u276fThe automotive industry is facing a particularly challenging \nsituation due to the demands arising from a new way of \nunderstanding mobility. How is Grupo Antolin responding to this \nenormous challenge?\nFirst of all, what we are certain about is that the vehicle will continue \nto be the main element in the new mobility, as it has been for more \nthan a century, but it will be a completely transformed vehicle that \nis more focused on people and their real needs. A vehicle that will \noffer services and features never seen before that will make it a more \nimportant space in our daily lives. Connectivity, digitalization and sus-\ntainability are the key elements of that transformation.

We \nare increasingly aware of the need to grow our re-\nsponsibility to the community, and the actions we \ntake to promote sustainable and inclusive develop-\nment must meet the expectations of our stakehold-\ners.\nThe economic and cultural evolution of modern so-\nciety requires businesses that operate on the mar-\nket to act not only as economic operators, but as \na social institution. It is a new dimension, one that \nrequires businesses to shoulder responsibility and \ndrives us towards new horizons and increasingly \nambitious targets.

All material assumptions and technical \nparameters, including in the estimation of Mineral Resources  \nor Ore Reserves, underpinning the estimates in the Enhanced  \nDFS continue to apply and have not materially changed.  \nThe estimated Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources underpinning \nthe production and financial forecasts in the Enhanced DFS \nwere prepared by Competent Persons in accordance with the \nrequirements in Appendix 5A (JORC Code).\nBLACK ROCK MINING LIMITED\n2020 ANNUAL REPORT\n01\n\nBlack Rock has built a solid \nfoundation that has distinguished and \nvalidated its \u201cCrawl, Walk, Run, Sprint\u201d \ndevelopment strategy. At its core, the \ngeology and geographical advantages \nat Mahenge provide for a very unique \nopportunity of a high-grade large \nflake graphite deposit, supported \nby rail access to deep water ports \nand access to grid power. Continued \nfocus on de-risking the project and \naligning partner supply chain has \nproved pivotal in differentiating the \noperating model for Mahenge. \nEarly in the year, the Company \nreleased an enhanced Definitive \nFeasibility Study (eDFS), effectively \nan optimized version of the original \nDefinitive Feasibility Study (DFS) \nnow including a fourth production \nmodule. This enhancement was done \nin response to customer demand \nfor a more aggressive ramp up. \nThe development sequence was \nalso compressed for modules to be \ncommissioned annually after first \nproduction, subject to funding and \nconfirmed demand, targeted steady \nstate annual production was to \nincrease from 250,000 to 340,000 \ntonnes. This delivered a revised \nset of financial metrics which saw \na forecasted increase of 30% to \nNPV10 rising to US$1.16Bn, IRR of \n44.8% (after tax and Free Carried \nInterest), with no material change to \ncapex for module one of US$116m1. \nImportantly, the scale and significance \nof the Mahenge Graphite project was \nevident with the eDFS forecasting a \nstable state EBITDA (after year 5) of \nUS$306M per annum at our basket \nprice of $1,301 per tonne for 97.5% \nconcentrate. The Company continues \nto believe that Mahenge is the best \nundeveloped graphite project globally.\nDuring the year, Black Rock has \nfocused heavily on development and \nvalidation, with a particular view on \nchannel development. This required \nthe Company to put material in \nthe hands of customers to try it. In \nAugust 2019, Black Rock announced \nthat its battery anode pre-cursor \nproduction trial delivered industry \nleading results, with spheronising \nyields of up to 53% and final purity \nof 99.98% Total Graphitic Carbon as \nreported by Loss on Ignition (LOI). \nThis significantly exceeded industry \nstandard for battery anode materials \nof 35-45% and 99", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

With 52 sites and almost 3,500 employees over 4 continents it could have been \ndifferent, very different, but we are happy to report no loss of life and a solid business. In Private \nEquity, sustainability proved a strong source of resilience with aggregate 2020 portfolio revenues \nbroadly in line with 2019 and EBITDA just a notch below. No portfolio company was severely \nimpacted by Covid, and we expect 2021 to bring our portfolio beyond 2019 levels. \nI like to believe this outcome is not only the result of the hard work of the extended team, but \nalso also the consequence of other factors: our companies, sustainability champions, are on the \n\u201cright side of history\u201d; our management action is led by clear governance; our ESG integration \nis pervasive; our enthusiasm for sustainability and inclusion is in line with the times. Our 2020 \nresults are living proof of it.\nWe posted significant progress on fund deployment and the expansion of our organization. We \ncompleted one new platform investment in 2020, in Namirial, a digital transaction management \ncompany whose solutions lead to the saving of materials, water, energy, and landfill, as well as \nto the reduction of CO2 emissions. We also completed four add-on acquisitions in the US, UK \nand Italy for our existing portfolio. Ambienta II was over 100% deployed as at Dec 2020, while \nAmbienta III continued its solid investment pace with around 48% deployed to date. \nWe recruited two new partners in 2020: Gwenaelle Le Ho Daguzan and Hans Haderer. Gwenaelle, \nAmbienta\u2019s first female partner, leveraging our differentiating sustainability leadership, was very \neffective in swiftly opening and staffing our new office in Paris, in very competitive market such \nas France. We now have a solid pipeline and a local team to process it. Hans strengthens our \nleadership in Germany as Head of the DACH region. We also established a Value Creation \npractice, led by two senior professionals with extensive experience in operations.\nWith our dedicated Sustainability & Strategy team, the pillar to developing proprietary sustainability \ntools, in 2020 we successfully expanded into public markets. We launched Ambienta X with a new \ndedicated team of 6 experienced public markets professionals: the first family of sustainability-\ndriven public market strategies available on the market based on the Ambienta Sustainability \nIndex, a proprietary quantitative sustainability scoring system for investee companies that we \ndeveloped internally. Ambienta X started trading its first long/short absolute return fund in March \n2020. The strategy gained speed very fast, reaching \u20ac 400m in assets at the end of 2020. \nWe believe environmental sustainability is the strongest growth trend shaping markets for the \nyears to come. 2020 was a great year for us, as a leader in sustainability, and we look forward to \na successful 2021!\nMessage from our Managing Partner and Founder\nSince 2007 we have been investing to solve one of the greatest challenges of our times\n4\n\nCovid posed a big challenge to our private equity portfolio in 2020. Business continuity has been \na top priority, while sustainability driven business models thankfully had only limited exposure to \nthe economic consequences of the pandemic. We worked closely with our companies to respond \nto the crisis with immediate and solid business continuity plans which were all implemented and \nproved to be effective.\nOur ESG in Action programme has been once again refined to continue to lead best practice in \nESG integration: we mandate PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit the implementation of our ESG in \nAction programme across our private equity portfolio. This is a new ground-breaking field where \nAmbienta once again is first mover in its leadership in ESG and responsible investing. \nDiversity has been sponsored at the highest levels of the organization, with a formal ad hoc \npolicy, and we made great progress in 2020 with the entrance of a female partner and the hiring \nof a woman director to chair the Board of Ambienta SGR. \nAmbienta has continued to gather awards and recognition across the industry.

Fifteen \nyears of expansion and leadership, regardless the context around us. We manage over \u20ac1.5b \nin assets and we operate across 4 European offices, with Paris and Munich launched mid-\npandemic. Ambienta\u2019s team is rapidly growing, now strong of 57 resources with more to come.\nOur Private Equity portfolio once again proves that true sustainability equals resilience. In 2021, \nwith Covid, our companies experienced 12% revenues growth against 2019, pre-pandemic \nlevels, and 14% EBITDA growth. No life was lost to Covid among our companies\u2019 68 sites with \nover 3.500 employees and business in 148 countries. 2021 was an opportunity for origination; \nwe completed three new platform investments \u2011 Caprari, Collingwood and Cap Vert \u2011 and five \nadd-on acquisitions. \nAmbienta X, our 2020 Public Market division, first to apply quantitative sustainability \nmethodologies in public equity, as we were first to do so in the buyout world, expanded and \nlaunched three new strategies based on environmental trends: two long only and one low \nvolatility. The division is already among the largest true sustainability HFs in the world and is \nabout to be distributed worldwide. \nSince 2007, the year we started-up, we saw several global crises, but we remained true to our \nconviction that environmental mega trends are the greatest long-term change in the history \nof the world economy. Now again, we are facing a storm of volatility and complexity: the \npandemic still rages on in some areas, supply chains are disrupted, inflation is exploding, a war \nin Europe, skyrocketing energy prices and the urgency of strategic independence. Confronted \nwith these raising challenges the world still found drive and determination to move towards \nsustainability with new regulatory requirements and a renewed attention to decarbonization. \nThere is full convergence with our historic vision that environmental sustainability and ESG \nmanagement are fundamental levers for value creation and a baseline of resilience against \nmarket volatility. \nOur vision has proven itself time and time again; our implementation has always aimed at \ngrowing our business responsibly: values such as transparency, diversity, meritocracy, and \ncollaboration have supported us towards reaching extraordinary results.  As always, also \nin the face of this latest crisis, we have acted responsibly disengaging immediately from all \nportfolio activities in Russia and Belarus.\nOur coherence speaks louder than words. We are B-Corp certified since 2019 and Carbon \nNeutral since 2020. In 2021 we continued our extensive engagement on ESG matters across \nthe asset management industry. All recent product launches are and will be classified as Art. \n9 under the SFDR. PRI has awarded us their top score since 2017.\nIn 2022, our fifteenth anniversary, we will continue our growth. We will be first movers again \nby bringing our environmental insight, and quantitative methodologies, in the world of Private \nCredit: our third strategy after private and public equity. We will also raise our fourth Private \nEquity fund, of course classified as Art. 9 under the SFDR, and further expand Ambienta X \nwith global distribution.\nWe look forward to a new successful year!\nNino Tronchetti Provera\nMessage from our Managing Partner and Founder\nSince 2007 we invest in the most mega of all megatrends\n4\n\nWhile markets continue to challenge our private and public portfolios, true sustainability \nkeeps proving a synonym for resilient businesses. In 2021, despite Covid and supply chain \ndisruptions, our Ambienta II EBITDA grew from \u20ac55.6m in 2020 to \u20ac65.4m and Ambienta III \nfrom \u20ac96.8m to \u20ac111.6m.

You will also learn more about some of the \ncompelling ways that our portfolio companies are driving meaningful change to support the \nUN Sustainable Development Goals.  In 2019, our portfolio companies helped to avoid over \n500 million metric tons of greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere, and employ \napproximately 16,000 people globally in green jobs.  \n \nAngeleno Group and its portfolio companies strive to be at the forefront of innovation and \nbest practices across the following ESG impact themes: Renewable Energy, Energy and \nResource Efficiency, Water, Smart Cities, Sustainable Forestry and Diversity and Inclusion. \n \nBy actively engaging with our portfolio companies to manage and improve performance on \nmaterial ESG topics, we believe that we are better able to support them in their efforts to \nmaximize their environmental, social and financial impact. Over the past nine years, a \ncommitment to ESG principles has helped our firm and portfolio companies proactively \nmanage risks, achieve important business milestones, and better serve all stakeholders.  In \n2019, we deepened our focus to utilize the Task Force for Climate-Related Disclosures as a \nframework to monitor both climate change risks and opportunities. \n \nAs we embark on a new decade \u2013 even in the midst of unprecedented global challenges \u2013  \nwe are excited about the future investment opportunities associated with the energy \ntransition and the growth of the low carbon economy. At Angeleno Group, we remain highly \nconvicted about the long-term tailwinds in our sector \u2013 the need to generate renewable \npower at scale, make cities smarter and more resilient, and transition to a more electrified, \ndigitized and sustainable world.  \n \nWe believe that we are well positioned, in our role as a provider of growth capital and an \nactive owner, to support the next generation of ESG-leading companies harnessing emerging \nclean energy and climate solutions technologies in the years to come. \n \nOn behalf of our entire team, we look forward to continued partnership with our investors, \nportfolio companies and stakeholders.  \n \n \n \n \nYaniv Tepper \nManaging Partner \nDaniel Weiss \nManaging Partner \nWilliam Miller \nChief Operating \nOfficer \nMichelle Kincanon \nVP, Finance & \nSustainability \n \n \n \n\n                                                                                                                                  ANGELENO \nGROUP \n \n \n2019 ESG REPORT \n \n \n \n2 \nFIRM PROFILE   \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \n \nINVESTING IN NEXT GENERATION CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE SOLUTIONS \nCOMPANIES \nFounded in 2001, Angeleno Group is a pioneer in providing growth capital for next generation \nclean energy and climate solutions companies.

The report provides us \nwith the opportunity to reflect on how our Responsible and Sustainable Investing Program \nhas evolved over the past decade, and also to look forward to the future and, in particular, to \nthe decade ahead. \n \n2020 was a momentous year in numerous ways. Being faced with the COVID-19 pandemic \nshowed us how interconnected we are, and how adaptive and resilient we can be. The social \njustice movement brought to the forefront systemic discrimination issues that businesses \nand society must address. The public and private markets exhibited remarkable growth in the \nclean energy sector. An inflection point was also reached among investors, corporations and \ngovernments that the need to transition to a low carbon economy cannot be delayed \u2013 and \nthat a commitment to ESG principles will be integral to achieving long-term returns and \ncreating shared value for all.   \n \nIn our role as an active owner, Angeleno Group is focused on supporting the next generation \nof ESG-leading companies as they harness innovative clean energy and climate solutions, \nand bring these solutions to scale. We remain highly convicted about the long-term tailwinds \nin our sector \u2013 the need to generate renewable power at scale, make cities smarter and more \nresilient, and transition to a more electrified, digitized and sustainable world.  \n \nBy applying a thoughtful, holistic and rigorous approach to integrating ESG principles into \nportfolio management, we are able to support our portfolio companies to meet their growth \nobjectives and to deliver shared value. In 2020, our portfolio companies helped to avoid \nnearly 700 million metric tons of greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere, and \nemployed approximately 17,000 people globally in green jobs. \n \nAs we move forward in this critical decade \u2013 one that has been referred to as the climate \ndecade \u2013 to make progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals and advance \ncommitments driven by the Paris climate accord, Angeleno Group is well-positioned to \nprovide meaningful growth capital to support these imperatives. \n \nWe would like to extend our sincerest thanks to our staff, portfolio companies, partners and \nadvisors who have deftly and diligently navigated the challenges that the COVID-19 \npandemic presented.   \n \nOn behalf of our entire team, we look forward to continued partnership with our investors, \nportfolio companies and stakeholders to achieve environmental, social and financial impact. \n \n \n \n \n \nYaniv Tepper \nManaging Partner \nDaniel Weiss \nManaging Partner \nWilliam Miller \nChief Operating \nOfficer \nMichelle Kincanon \nVP, Finance & \nSustainability \n\n                                                                                                                                  ANGELENO \nGROUP \n \n2020 ESG REPORT \n \n \n2 \nFIRM PROFILE   \n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \n \nINVESTING IN NEXT GENERATION CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE SOLUTIONS \nCOMPANIES \nFounded in 2001, Angeleno Group is a pioneer in providing growth capital for next generation \nclean energy and climate solutions companies.

During the \nyear, thousands of children contacted us to \nshare their LEGO experiences. It gives such \nstrong purpose to our work when we see \nfirst-hand the pride, skill, and excitement, \nthat comes with creating and sharing a \nLEGO build!\nInvesting in long-term growth\nThe progress we made in advancing strate\u00ad\ngic investments will fuel growth now, and \nfor generations to come. Investments in \nproduct innovation, retail experiences, \ndigitalisation, and sustainability will keep \nour brand relevant and create opportunities \nfor more children to benefit from play. \nOur 2021 portfolio was the largest and \nmost diverse ever. We saw strong perfor-\nmances from our homegrown themes such \nas LEGO NINJAGO which celebrated its 10th \nanniversary, and licensed themes such as \nLEGO Super Mario\u2122 and LEGO Star Wars\u2122. \nWe also welcomed adults with a range of \nchallenging builds which brought families \ntogether and inspired fans of all ages.  \nOur successful Rebuild the World brand \ncampaign further strengthened love for the \nbrand, and we announced steps to remove \nharmful gender stereotypes from our \nmarke\u00adting and products so that all builders \neverywhere feel included. \nInnovative retail channels\nWe continued to welcome visitors back to \nour stores and unveiled a new retail format \ndesigned to create immersive, memorable \nbrand experiences. We continue to see \nvalue in physical retail stores and opened \n165 LEGO branded stores around the \nworld in 2021. Long-term investments in \ne-\u00adcommerce continue to pay off, helping \nto drive double-digit growth in online sales \nacross our own and partner channels.\n \nExpanding global supply chain \nOur long-standing network of factories \npositioned us well to navigate the supply \nchallenges that affected all industries. \nOur five manufacturing sites on three \ncontinents make our supply chain short, \nflexible, and able to meet shifting demand \nin our largest markets. We will continue \nto invest in expanding capacity across our \nmanufacturing network to meet long-term \ngrowth and announced plans to build a \nnew operationally carbon neutral factory in \nVietnam. \nBuilding a sustainable future brick by brick\nChildren are increasingly concerned about \nthe future of the planet. We are committed \nto giving them a voice and taking action to \nbecome a more sustainable company. After \nthree years of research and development, we \nannounced a breakthrough with our proto-\ntype brick made from recycled PET bottles. \nFor COP26 (UN Climate Change Conference \nof the Parties), we met with children to hear \ntheir ideas and released a set of ten Building \nInstructions for a Better World. \nI am optimistic the planet will be in safe \nhands with today\u2019s builders of tomorrow. \nThey inspire us with their creativity, \nresilience, and optimism.

Whether it\u2019s using more recycled materials in our products, \nor transitioning our supply chain to 100 percent clean energy, there \nis no part of Apple this work does not reach.\nThis year\u2019s Environmental Progress Report shows the breadth of the environmental \nsolutions we\u2019re advancing, and the scale of collaboration that helped make them \npossible. The details here matter, because they add up to meaningful, substantive \nprogress in our work for the planet. We are laser-focused on our commitment to \nachieve carbon neutrality for our entire footprint by 2030, a goal we have already \nreached for our own operations. At the same time, we\u2019re working to one day make \nour products without taking from the earth, and to be a force for equity in the world \naround us.\nAcross all of these efforts, we never lose sight of our primary mission \u2014 working \nto address the climate crisis. It\u2019s an urgent challenge no one company, entity or \nindividual can tackle alone, and this year, we\u2019re addressing it with more ambition than \never before. In fact, we\u2019ve begun to decouple business growth from emissions as we \ndrive towards our goal of bringing our entire carbon footprint to net zero by 2030 \u2014 \nincluding our supply chain and the use of our products. While our revenue grew  \n33 percent, our net emissions remained flat. \nToday, 213 of our suppliers \u2014 representing the majority of Apple\u2019s direct supplier \nspend \u2014 are committed to using 100 percent renewable energy for their Apple \nbusiness. In\u00a0the last year, we more than doubled the amount of clean energy used to \nmanufacture Apple products.\nWe\u2019re also making great strides toward our goal of one day making our products \nwithout mining. In fiscal year 2021, nearly 20 percent of the materials we shipped in \nApple products came from recycled sources. We\u2019ve more than doubled our use of \nrecycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt. And initiatives like our Apple Trade \nIn program, and advancements in recycling technology, continue to reduce our impact \non the planet by using yesterday\u2019s products to help build tomorrow\u2019s.\nReflections\nIntroduction    Climate Change    Resources    Smarter Chemistry    Engagement    Appendix\n2022 Environmental Progress Report  3\n\nWe also know that a greener future must be a more equitable one. It\u2019s why we \ncontinue to advance our Impact Accelerator, which invests in a diverse class of \nentrepreneurs developing next generation innovations in green technologies. That \nincludes leaders like Karl Johnson, whose company develops environmentally-friendly \nadhesives that make it easier to repair and recycle new technologies, or Betty Manetta \nwhose company has pioneered an AI-based, real-time data collection process to \nassess energy consumption for its users.\nEquity also drives the mission of our Power for Impact initiative, which we launched to \nhelp connect underserved communities with clean, renewable energy. In communities \nfrom South Africa to the Philippines, from Thailand to Israel, we\u2019ve helped bring solar \nand wind energy to schools, hospitals, and rural communities.\nAnd, working with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, our Restore Fund \ninvests to develop working forests \u2014 which support local economic opportunity while \nsequestering carbon from the atmosphere.\nAt Apple, we believe in making bold commitments to improve the world around us \u2014 \nand taking bold steps to meet them.

So we set an even more ambitious \ngoal \u2014 to make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire \nsupply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers\u2019 devices. \nTeams across Apple quickly got to work, and thanks to their innovations, \nwe\u2019ve made extraordinary progress.\nIn this year\u2019s report, you\u2019ll find the most detailed portrait yet of where we \nare today and where we\u2019re headed. Here\u2019s the big picture: Since 2015, \nwe\u2019ve reduced our emissions by over 45 percent. We did it while reaching \nmore Apple users than ever before. And, in doing so, we demonstrated \nthat the choice between a thriving business and a thriving planet is a \nfalse one.\nThis was also the year we called on our suppliers to accelerate their \nwork to address their emissions. We\u2019ve sent a clear message that the \ncompanies who manufacture our products must decarbonize their entire \nApple footprint by 2030, including the use of 100 percent renewable \nelectricity. And today, over 250 of our suppliers \u2014 accounting for over \n85 percent of Apple\u2019s direct manufacturing spend \u2014 are a part of our \nSupplier Clean Energy Program.\nWe share our progress \u2014 and our goals \u2014 because transparency and \naccountability are two sides of the same coin. We do the work and we \nshow our work, because we want to be the ripple in the pond that creates \na broader change.\nThis year, we\u2019ve also made it easier to understand the carbon impact of \nyour Apple devices, and the extraordinary steps we\u2019re taking to reduce \ntheir emissions. In our Product Environment Reports, you can learn about \nrecycled gold in your iPhone, the energy demands of your iPad, and the \npackaging around your Mac. We\u2019re transforming so many aspects of the \nway we make our technology, and with our Product Environment Reports, \nyou\u2019ll see where we\u2019ve made progress and where the hard work remains.\nOne thing is clear: We\u2019re closer than ever to the day you can hold your \nApple device and be confident in the knowledge that it has net-zero \ncarbon impact. There are few companies that can make that claim \u2014 let \nalone ones that set our high standards and transparently show their \nprogress along the way.\nAs we move closer to our goals, we\u2019ve continued to push the pace by \nbringing new clean energy online to power our supply chain. And we\u2019re \ninvesting in a growing number of renewable energy projects to balance \nthe electricity our customers use to charge their devices.\nRecycled materials are also a key focus of our innovations, and another \nway we\u2019re driving down our emissions. Today, about 20 percent of the \nmaterials in our products are from recycled or renewable sources. Our \ngoal is to one day reach 100 percent, and to end our reliance on mining \naltogether. Where we continue to extract materials, we maintain the \nhighest standards in our due diligence and respect for human rights. And \nwe\u2019re accelerating our work with new goals to use 100 percent recycled \ncobalt, tin, gold, and rare earth elements in key components by 2025. \nThe strides we\u2019re making play a huge role in driving down our emissions \neven further, reducing our reliance on energy-intensive mining, smelting, \nand refining.\nWe\u2019ll keep pursuing creative ways to reduce our footprint, and only use \nhigh-quality carbon offsets to balance emissions we can\u2019t zero out. That\u2019s \nwhy we launched the Restore Fund, which aims to help businesses invest \nin high-quality, nature-based solutions that restore the forests, wetlands, \nand grasslands that remove carbon from our atmosphere.\nEquity remains a central focus of our investments in clean energy and \ngreen technology.

The report should  \nbe read in conjunction with our Framework for Sustainable Finance.\nIn the year to 31 March 2020, we invested over \u00a3198 million and built more  \nthan 1,000 homes, providing almost 3,000 people with access to new  \naffordable housing. Our development programme is focused on building  \nnew homes with a range of housing options, whilst maintaining a strong  \nprogramme of affordable rented homes as well as supporting housing  \ndevelopment in rural communities.\nWe also partnered with East Boro Housing Trust, (East Boro) and  \nwere delighted to welcome over 150 new colleagues to the Group  \non 31 March 2020. Social impact is a key priority in the delivery  \nof our growth strategy. Growth supports our commitment to  \ndo things in an ethical way, and we consider a range of  \noptions to work in partnerships to enhance our social  \nimpact in our communities.\nIntroduction\nEnvironmental,  \nSocial & Governance  \n(ESG) Report\n2019 / 2020\n\nWe made significant investments in our homes, going above and beyond compliance \nand investing \u00a362.8 million maintaining and improving our existing properties and  \n\u00a39.2 million on a range of health and fire safety measures. We make the best use of  \nour assets by improving the quality of shared communal areas and investing in the \nestates in which they live to help create communities that people are proud of.  \nWe maximise the use of our land to deliver more homes and community facilities. \nWithin our communities we aim to make a positive contribution towards a net \ncarbon reduction, improve the energy efficiency of our stock and limit the  \nimpact on the environment.\nThis year also saw us continue to work towards every one of our homes \nreceiving an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of  \u2018C\u2019 or above  \nby 2025, five years ahead of the Government target, and through the Warm \nHomes fund we are pleased to have been able to reduce the impact of fuel \npoverty for 81% of customers involved in the scheme.\nListening and responding to the opinions of customers and the feedback \nfrom over 4,000 customers in our latest full customer survey, has \nplayed an important part in shaping decisions that we have made this \nyear and has resulted in a number of services being enhanced and \nimproved. Through the Aster Foundation we continue to empower our \ncustomers to sustain their tenancies and improve their life chances, \nenabling their independence, creating a lasting legacy through our \nthriving communities and sustaining the workforce of the future. It \nalso looks to develop innovative ways to create environmentally \nactive partnerships and embed our sustainability approach \nacross our communities - targeting our investment at the  \nplaces we can make the most impact, will help deliver social \nvalue to our customers.\nThroughout 2019 and 2020, we continued to evolve our \ndigital offer to make it as easy as possible for customers to \naccess the information they need when they need it. And \nwith almost 12,000 customers registered for MyAster, an \ninteractive self-service app that allows customers to \nbook repairs and manage their data, we\u2019re looking at \nmore ways to provide instant access to the things \nthat matter to our customers. \nMore information can be found on our websi", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

We seek to work \ncollaboratively with our portfolio company management teams to embed ESG & \nSustainability principles and goals in their business strategies and operations and \nmonitor performance to ensure that progress is being made. Our annual ESG & \nSustainability report is one of the principal ways in which we seek to communicate \nto our stakeholders on the progress that has been made across a number of ESG \ninitiatives both at TDR and our portfolio. \nThe last twelve months have brought new challenges in Europe as the impact of \nthe pandemic largely subsided to be rapidly replaced by supply chain constraints, \ninflationary and interest rate pressures and a cost of living crisis for many consumers. \nThe environment has meant that our businesses have needed to remain nimble \nand innovative in order to mitigate the financial impacts of these challenges while \nimportantly, needing to focus on supporting their employees, customers and the \ncommunities in which they operate in an attempt to alleviate some of the more \nacute pressures on household budgets. \nSeparately, we have continued to focus on climate change, working on further \nunderstanding the risks and opportunities within our portfolio companies, building \non the groundwork undertaken with a  specialist climate change consultancy \nlast year. We have also worked closely with our portfolio companies to help them \nadd ESG & Sustainability talent including at the most senior level.

We have recently rolled out the Worldfavor reporting \nplatform to all of our portfolio companies which we believe will further improve the \ncollection and analysis of ESG data. Furthermore, we believe we can leverage our \nin-house data science expertise to analyse the complex data that we will now be \nable to systematically collect and use this analysis to drive positive ESG outcomes. \nFinally, we continue to encourage equality, diversity and inclusion (ED&I) initiatives \nacross the portfolio and our own activities as well as supporting a number of \nindustry-wide initiatives to improve diversity in the investment industry. We firmly \nbelieve that diversity of perspective leads to better decision-making and are \npleased to have made significant progress in recent years on improving gender \ndiversity within the TDR team such that 50% of the investment team below Partner \nlevel is now female.\nThis report provides more insights into these and many more initiatives across our \nportfolio and at TDR to drive our ESG & Sustainability efforts. Whilst there is good \nprogress, we recognise there is still further work to do. Our focus areas for the \ncoming year include extending the coverage of carbon reporting and working \nwith portfolio companies to set carbon reduction targets, the ongoing promotion \nof inclusive working practices across the portfolio and our own activities, whilst \ncontinuing to provide firm-level support to a range of industry and charitable \ninitiatives.  \nWe hope you enjoy reading our 2021/2022 ESG & Sustainability report.\nThe TDR Partners\nWELCOME\nWelcome\nCONTENTS\nWELCOME\n01-02\nWHO WE ARE\n03-08\nESG AT TDR\n09-10\nENVIRONMENT\n11-20\nSOCIAL\n21-28\nGOVERNANCE\n29-36\n\n3\u2003  \u2003 \u2003 ESG & Sustainability Report 2021/22\n\u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 4\nSince our establishment in 2002, TDR \nCapital has focused on acquiring \nmajority stakes in market-leading \nEuropean companies with potential \nfor robust growth and resilience \nthrough economic cycles.

But the same conditions \nthat rocked our industry also highlighted our \nresponsibility to our people, our clients and our \ncommunity. In challenge, we found opportunities  \nto serve, to innovate, to:\nLive our values. For years, in speaking to clients, \nprospects, the press and our own people, we\u2019ve \ncalled out our BCD culture as a true differentiator. \nThe events of 2020 put that culture on shining \ndisplay, as we rose to meet challenge after challenge. \nWe\u2019ve never been prouder of our employees\u2019 \ncourage, willingness to serve and grace under \npressure\u2014and now, more than ever, these qualities \nremain crucial. We delivered on our promise to \nourselves and our clients to keep solving together, \nacting with purpose, doing what\u2019s right, giving our \nbest and feeding the future. \nAlign under our core strategies. Together, \nwe strengthened the partnership, simplicity and \ninnovation that our people and our clients perceive \nand receive at BCD. We delivered experiences and \nsolutions that kept people safe, healthy, productive \nand confident. We simplified complexity through \ntechnology innovations that anticipate what lies \nahead for our clients and their travelers. \nWe can look back at 2020 and be proud of \nwhat we achieved in the face of extraordinary \ncircumstances\u2014including our highest new sales \nand client retention ever. Our sales and retention \nlevels are far more than numbers on a page. They \nrepresent the deep trust our clients have both in \nour financial stability and our ability to deliver. They \nestablish a solid foundation for future growth as \ntravel returns. And they will continue to fuel our \ncapacity to focus on the essentials of sustainability.\nGRI 102-14, 102-15\n2\n\nSUSTAINABLE INNOVATION\nIn a year of unparalleled disruption, we moved \nforward on projects, initiatives and solutions that \nrepresent our firm commitment to sustainability. \nOur EcoVadis Platinum rating validated our \noutstanding sustainability performance, confirming \nour position in the top 1% of all companies assessed. \nWe would be remiss in not calling out several \ndevelopments that speak to the unique conditions of \n2020 and to the influence those conditions will have \non the way we and our clients will operate in the \nfuture:\nClimate change: The management of the \nenvironmental impact of our operations and the \ndevelopment of innovative solutions to help our \nclients make their travel programs more sustainable \nwere in focus in 2020. To be future fit to meet \nour internal goal to reduce carbon emissions \nsignificantly by 2030, we signed on to the Science \nBased Target initiative (SBTi). Our defined carbon \ngoals will be submitted by Q4 2021.\nSustainable collaboration: Our focus on \nsustainable travel doesn\u2019t just mean protecting \nthe environment and addressing climate change, \nit also covers traveler wellbeing and minimizing \nrisk.

Global summits like \nCOP26 are also setting a clearer pathway to reduce the \nimpact of climate change \u2013 and clarifying the role that \nBCD and others in our industry play in this effort. \nAcross industries, our clients have called for more \nactive contributions from their supplier partners to \ntheir commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, \nenvironmental impact, carbon reduction and business \nethics. The strong foundations that BCD has laid across \nour six sustainability Focus Areas meant that we were \nmore than ready for these greater expectations. \nAs we grow, we have an obligation to ourselves, our \nclients and our communities to do so sustainably. We\u2019ve \nconsistently demonstrated our commitment through our \nalignment with the UN Global Compact and Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, the Global Reporting Initiative and \nISO 26000. In 2020, we became the first global travel \nmanagement company to join the Science Based Targets \nInitiative (SBTi). \nFor the second year in a row  \nwe earned a Platinum rating  \nfrom EcoVadis, the world\u2019s largest \nand most trusted provider of \nindependent sustainability ratings. \nThe Platinum rating confirms our outstanding \nsustainability performance, validated best practices, and \nprovides transparency and risk mitigation. It also places \nBCD in the top 1% of the 90,000+ companies currently \nassessed by EcoVadis. \nBuilding sustainable travel programs \nIn a survey of 101 travel buyers conducted in November \nby BCD\u2019s Research & Intelligence team, almost 70% \nreported an increased interest in sustainability from their \ncompany\u2019s senior leadership. In 2021, we continued to \ndevelop solutions to enable clients to better integrate \nsustainable best practices into their travel programs, \nusing innovative practices so that they meet their \nsustainability targets.  \nFor many clients, environmental concerns remain firmly \ntop of mind. From achieving ISO certification for Advito\u2019s \nproprietary carbon emissions methodology initially \npiloted in 2020, to launching a new practice designed to \nhelp customers take advantage of high-speed rail, we\u2019re \nhelping them optimize spend, reduce carbon emissions, \nand increase traveler productivity and satisfaction. At \nthe same time, we\u2019re focused on encouraging companies \nto think more broadly \u2013 and helping them expand their \ntravel program sustainability conversation to include \nsocial and governance aspects. We remain committed \nto being at the forefront of what a sustainable travel \nprogram looks like for our clients.  \nLetter from our Executives\nThe uncertainty the world faced in 2020 rolled into 2021, \nas COVID-19 continued to affect nations, businesses and \nindividuals alike. Being a business travel stakeholder \nin 2021 required clear-eyed realism, as we watched \nrestrictions on travel loosen, tighten and loosen again \nin countries around the world. But we leaned into our \ninnate capacity resilience, taking the challenges we \u2013  \nand our clients \u2013 faced as an extraordinary opportunity \nfor evolution and an unprecedented chance to drive \nsustainable change.  \nIn 2021, we focused on exceeding rapidly shifting \nexpectations for sustainability within newly vulnerable \nglobal supply chains. As business travel began to \nreturn, we also continued to innovate in partnership \nwith customers in establishing new parameters for \nsustainable travel programs. And we looked inward as \nwell, creating opportunities to elevate our employees\u2019 \nexperience within BCD \u2013 with a particular focus on \nfurther raising D&I awareness and embedding D&I  \ninto our systems and policies. \nChanging expectations \nThe disruption presented by COVID-19, climate change \nand other world events in 2021 has encouraged \ncompanies to think critically about plotting a course for \nsustainable business travel ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

This objective has shaped our vision to be-\ncome the leading digital sports media group along with \nour mission to make sports entertainment more engag-\ning and fair. As a leader in the intersection of media and \nentertainment, with an element of igaming, we reach \nmillions of sports fans. With this position comes an obli-\ngation to ensure a responsible and sustainable offering \nincluding editorial guidelines, proper segmentation, and \nsafer gambling resources. \nOffering transparency in the \nindustry \nAs we are continually growing our business and adding \nnew entities, we dedicate our attention to initiatives that \nallow us to grow sustainably. Most importantly, we want \nto help sports fans navigate the world of sports betting \nby having them visit a Better Collective brand before \nregistering an account or placing a bet with a sports-\nbook. This is important as we only work with licensed \nsportsbooks in regulated markets. Our US leading sports \nbetting media; Action Network, has an app which is used \nby millions of sports fans. In this app, we have developed \nBetSync, which offers users the unique opportunity to \ntrack their bets and outcomes across several sports-\nbooks. This adds transparency and supports a sustaina-\nble betting behavior. We are excited about the positive \nfeedback we receive from BetSync users and the trans-\nparency we can offer down the line as we onboard more \nsportsbooks to the solution and explore more geogra-\nphies for the app. \nPlaying a key role in \nchannelization \nAs we operate in regulated markets with licensed \nsportsbooks, we play an important role in channeling us-\ners to the right sportsbooks. In the online marketplace, \nusers will be met with a multitude of offers, some of \nwhich are outside the regulated markets which means \nthat user protection measures may not be in place and \nmarketing practices non-compliant. Our objective is to \nwork with partners who proactively address safer gam-\nbling and given our position in the value chain, we aim \nto educate our users while pointing them towards legal \nsportsbooks. \n \n \n \n \nAnnual Report\nPage 40 \n \n\n \n \n \nAnnual Report\nPage 41 \n \nOur commitment to \nsustainability  \nBeing a business with operations structured around re-\nsponsible practices, we find it crucial to support the \noverall sustainable development of our world and indus-\ntry. This is why Better Collective committed to incorpo-\nrate the UN Global Compact and its 10 principles into our \nstrategy, culture, and day-to-day operations in 2019. \nWith this report, which is also our Communication on \nProgress, we renew our ongoing commitment to the in-\nitiative and our continued support for the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). As a result of our commit-\nment we always strive to operate in ways that meet fun-\ndamental responsibilities in the areas of human rights, \nlabor, environment and anti-corruption. We see our ef-\nforts and commitment as constant work which each year \ngets better, and we strive to supply the data to support \ntransparency of our efforts.  \nA talented and diverse work-\nforce is key \nIn 2022, we established a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion \ntopics in the Better Collective Group. A special focus this \nlast year has been actively pursuing a diverse workforce \nand ensuring equal opportunity to everyone. If we take \na quick look at our organization, it is evident that when \nit comes to females in leadership positions we are \u2013 like \nmost other companies in our industry \u2013 lagging behind. \nTo speed up our efforts and create awareness, we have \nrecently signed two pledges: The Confederation of Dan-\nish Industry\u2019s (DI) Gender Diversity Pledge along with \nthe UN\u2019s Women Empowerment Principles. We genu-\ninely believe that by having a better representation of \nsociety in our company and creating a working environ-\nment that is inclusive and fair, we will foster an innova-\ntive environment and, in the end, become a more sus-\ntainable and successful business. \nEnvironmental responsibility \n\u2018To strengthen our sustainability approach, we have \nbeen tracking our carbon emissions for the fourth con-\nsecutive year.

We reduced \nour consumption of single use plastics by:\n\t\n\u0084 over 100,000 items throughout our corporate \noffices nationally\n\t\n\u0084 over 1 million from the base building operations \nof our pilot assets, Brookfield Place Perth and \nBrookfield Place Sydney, and\n\t\n\u0084 over 700,000 by encouraging our Brookfield \nPlace Perth retail tenants to join us on the \njourney.\nThis is just the beginning. In 2022, we will roll out \nthe initiative to our entire Australian portfolio. \nAs the world searched for better ways to connect \nduring COVID-19, we launched our bespoke tenant \napp, axiis in Australia. This helped us build stronger, \nlonger-term connections with the people who \noccupy our office towers and mixed-use precincts. \naxiis allowed us to remain connected with our \ntenants during lockdowns across the country and \nallowed our placemaking to shift to  \nan always on environment. \nOur return-to-office strategies supported our \nretailers and offered promotions and giveaways \nto the people who work in our buildings to drive \nactivity in CBDs and encourage both a safe and \nengaging return to office. \nIn 2021, we also began the development of \nour inaugural Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan \n(RAP). The development of this RAP is an essential \nstep for our business as we look to extend our \nengagement with First Nations Peoples. We are \nstrongly committed to a future that is enriched and \nemboldened through a culture of reconciliation \nand inclusivity.

Also, \nESG reporting does not set aside, replace or substitute any reporting obligations of listed companies under existing \nlaws and regulations.\n3\n\nBSE AND \nSUSTAINABILITY\nIndian Economy is growing manifolds with increased development and spending across various sectors. With these \nmassive transitions and transformations the emphasis is more on creating businesses, not just about profit, but about \npeople and the planet.\nWe are committed to promote sustainable practices in our markets with the belief that businesses will only be \nsuccessful in the long run if their models respect the triple bottom line of \u201cprofit, planet and people\u201d.\nAdoption of regulatory framework across all verticals of the organisation enable long term thinking, broader \nunderstanding of risks and opportunities and improve connectivity between financial and non-financial drivers.\nCatering to voluntary adoption of certain norms is our contribution to the seriousness about respecting interests of \nvarious stakeholders.\nThis ESG Guidance document is a product of joint cooperation of various stakeholders. It intends to capture the best of \nprogressive ESG thinking and will be updated on an ongoing basis.\n4\n\nIMPORTANCE OF\nESG REPORTING\nRaises Corporate Transparency\nIt broadens organisational disclosure beyond traditional financial metrics and raises corporate transparency on environmental \nand social metrics.\nSustainability reporting allows a balanced and understandable assessment of the company\u2019s performance by stakeholders to \nfacilitate corporate accountability, as promulgated by one of the principles under the Code of Corporate Governance.\nStrengthens Risk Management\nSustainability reporting allows listed companies to consider emerging risk areas and to identify opportunities presented by \nrisks that are overlooked by other analytical and system driven approaches.\nA risk management approach that incorporates sustainability provides management with useful data for identifying emerging \nissues and developing appropriate responses that help protect corporate reputation and improve shareholder value.\nPromotes Stakeholder Engagement\nIdentification of and engagement with stakeholders are fundamental to sustainability reporting and are cited as critical steps by \nvarious international sustainability frameworks. Listed companies need to identify their stakeholders to effectively engage \nthose that are interested in and affected by the ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

It was a declaration of our commitment to \nuse our talents, technology, and resources to drive real change in the energy \nindustry and the world.  \nWe view environmental, social, and governance (ESG) as a key lever to \ntransform the performance of our company and our industry. Over the last \nyear we enhanced our programs and commitments, and have increased the \ntransparency of our reporting.\nThe dual challenge of energy and climate\nThe collective action of people and industry, when directed with purpose, can \nenable change on a global scale. The dual challenge of energy access and \nclimate change is one of the greatest issues facing our world. That is why \nBaker Hughes has committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions from our \noperations by 2050, and develop new solutions to help the oil and gas industry \nreduce carbon emissions across the entire value chain.\nThrough year-end 2019 our Scope 1 and 2 carbon equivalent emissions are \n31 percent lower than our 2012 baseline. Emissions increased slightly over \nthe prior year primarily driven by an increase in activity and expanding the \nboundary of what is reported in our Scope 1 emissions. However, most of \nthese increases were mitigated through energy efficiency improvements \nand emissions reduction projects around the globe; from facility upgrades, to \nrenewable energy projects, to logistics improvements. We will continue to take \naggressive actions that will support us on our journey to net zero.\nLeading with technology\nOur commitment to innovation has led to many high efficiency product and \nservice offerings that are helping customers reduce emissions in the field today. \nWe are investing in new technologies, products, and services that advance \n4\nBaker Hughes 2019 Report on Corporate Responsibility\nLetters from leadership\nDashboard\nCorporate responsibility framework\nPlanet\nPeople\nPrinciples\nIndex and data\n\nour industry in cleaner energy, from carbon capture and storage to hydrogen-\nfueled turbines that will help the industry continue to innovate toward a net \nzero future.

It is becoming increasingly clear, all over the world, that we \nmust act now to preserve the foundations of our livelihoods.\nAs an internationally operating business in the energy, agriculture \nand building materials industries, BayWa is affected by climate \nchange in many ways. That is why we want to make a particular \nimpact through our actions \u2013 true to the title of this year\u2019s Sustain\u00ad\nability Report. Last year we took a close look at the effects of our \nbusiness and adjusted our key fields of action in view of the United \nNations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals. Climate protection \nremains a key focal point. But we also want to make our supply \nchains more sustainable and raise awareness of diversity and \nbroaden knowledge of sustainability throughout our company.\nOur climate strategy, which we resolved in 2018 with the aim of \nensuring that we are carbon-neutral by 2030, is already having a \nsignificant effect. In order to achieve our aim, this year we commit\u00ad\nted to covering our entire electricity supply through renewable \nsources Group-wide by the end of 2020. The issue of sustainability \nis also becoming increasingly important on the stock market, too. \nOne example of this was the significant oversubscription of our \ngreen bond issued in mid-June 2019. This shows that investors \nview BayWa as a solid and attractive investment and trust the com\u00ad\npany to continue the BayWa r.e. success story.\n \nWe also want to make an impact when it comes to diversity. As an \ninternational company, we know that diversity in gender, beliefs, \nage and background has a positive effect on the corporate culture \nand opens the door to more creative solutions and better results \u2013 \nand this too is a contribution to sustainability. In 2019, we signed \nthe Diversity Charter and committed to promoting and embracing \ndiversity throughout the company.\nThis report shows how we were able to make an impact for more \nsustainability in the previous year. It draws on management con\u00ad\ncepts to show how we act and details performance indicators to \ndemonstrate what specific effects our actions are having. We are \nconvinced that one of the ways a company can express its reliabil\u00ad\nity is through transparency, whether it be to employees, custom\u00ad\ners, partners, society or policymakers.\nI would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication to \nsustainability, day in, day out, which makes an impact at many levels \nof the company. And I would also like to call on all of our partners, \ncustomers and suppliers to join us in making sustainability a reality.\nBest regards,\n\nProf. Klaus Josef Lutz\nChief Executive Officer of BayWa AG\nForeword des Vorstand\nProf. Klaus Josef Lutz\nChief Executive Officer of BayWa AG\nIntroduction\nBayWa AG\u2003 Sustainability Report 2019\n03\nIntroduction\u2003 Foreword\n\nMarket\nStrategy and  \nGovernance\nContents\nEnvironment  \nand Climate\nEmployees\nQuality of Life\nAppendix\nIntroduction\nWith its sixth Sustainability Report, BayWa gives an account of \nhow it puts its corporate responsibility into practice.

We are \nstrengthening our position globally by systematically investing in the expansion and op-\ntimization of our supply chain capacities and capabilities. All of these efforts are carried \nout with a clear commitment to sustainability in each region. \nAs part of our C.A.R.E.+ strategy, we are focusing even more on local consumer needs. \nOur 14 production centers are located in the Europe, Americas, Near East (incl. Africa), \nand Asia-Pacific regions. They manufacture mainly for their local and regional markets, \nfocusing on processing and filling activities. The production network is complemented \nby selected third-party manufacturers (3PMs). Prime materials are sourced directly from \nour suppliers. To meet the needs of our consumers and run an increasingly agile supply \nchain, we perform ongoing supply network analyses and continuously update our supply \nnetwork. Our production sites and 3PMs deliver goods through a network of warehouses \nand distribution centers to our customers. Most warehousing and transportation services \nare externally purchased; only two warehouses are owned and operated by Beiersdorf. \nLast minute differentiation (co-packing) is mainly integrated in warehouse operations.\nThe material sourcing footprint reflects the needs of innovation and the product assort-\nment, on the one hand, and the changes in the production center network, on the other. \nRecycled materials, natural ingredients, and the new production site in Leipzig require \nchanges in our material sourcing. Our efforts targeting resilience improvement and \nsupply risk management to assure business continuity form part of a continuous journey \nfor enhancing our material supply. \nIn 2022, the most prominent changes within the Beiersdorf supply chain were related to \nthe continuous efforts to update our production network.\n\nBeiersdorf\nGRI CONTENT INDEX 2022\n3\nDisclosure\nGRI Standard Information\nReference\nSDG\nUNGC\nWe are currently investing in expansion and modernization projects at our sites in \nGermany, Indonesia, Poland, Mexico, and Spain.

Our Workplace Giving \nProgram, which allows employees to donate a portion of their \nweekly pre-tax income to a charity of their choice, has contributed \nover $6 million to charitable organisations since its inception.  \nOur Participation Rate is at 36% of employees during Period 13 \nFY22, up from 27% during Period 13 FY21.\nAt Collins Foods, we consider our people our greatest asset.  \nWith over 17,000 employees, we are dedicated to creating a strong \nculture of empowered reporting, safety and belonging. With \ndomestic violence rates continuing to rise across the country, \nCollins Foods has worked with external specialists to create an \nawareness and support program for employees who may be \naffected. The program includes up to $5,000 of financial support \nand five days of paid leave as circumstances may require.\nWe also strive to provide safe and healthy workplaces across all \nbrands and restaurant support centres and invest in a range of \ninitiatives that support our people, focusing on inclusion, diversity, \nreward and recognition, and training. To continue growing our \nculture of acceptance and belonging, our Diversity and Inclusion \nCouncil established four working groups \u2014 LGBTQI+, Disability, \nMulticultural, and Equality \u2014 each tasked with delivering an \noverarching roadmap for the enhancement of diversity and \ninclusion initiatives across Collins Foods, to strengthen our  \nculture of belonging.\nPlanet\nWe acknowledge the importance of having a role in tackling climate \nchange and pollution. To play our part, Collins Foods has become \nthe only quick service restaurant (QSR) company in Australia to \ncommit to installing solar panels in every possible free-standing \ndrive-thru restaurant. During the year, we installed 89 additional \nsolar panel-based energy systems to 89 drive-thru restaurants. \nGovernance\nWe cannot deliver on our ESG goals without proper governance \nin place. At Collins Foods, we have high standards of corporate \ngovernance, recognising that good governance not only protects \nand enhances stakeholder interests but is important to our  \nongoing success. \nDuring the year, the Collins Foods Board updated the Audit and \nRisk Committee Charter to include sustainability as a Committee \nresponsibility. \nAs an ASX-listed corporation, we respect and support the integrity \nof the market where investors trade in Collins Foods\u2019 shares  \n(ASX: CKF) and from which we access capital. An overview of Collins \nFoods\u2019 corporate governance practices is set out in our corporate \ngovernance statement available at www.collinsfoods.com.\nWe seek continuous improvement to maintain best-practice \ngovernance standards.\nThe future outlook\nOur Sustainability Report is a key representation of our success \nstories and future plans \u2014 we look forward to sharing our \nimprovements year on year.

This is an integral part of \nour business strategy. This report aims to share with you how we continue \nto progress along this path.\u00a0\n \nClimate change presents probably the most pressing challenge of all. Nat-\nurally, our prime objective is to run our operations on a net-zero emissions \nbasis, in step with the Paris climate goals. In 2021, we increased our ambi-\ntions and committed to reduce our absolute emissions from our operations \nby 100% already by 2030, compared to 2015 levels; at the end of 2021, we \nhave already achieved a reduction of -56%.\nAs a leading bank-insures our impact must, however, reach further. We have \nnow started incorporating new ambitions in terms of improving the CO2 im-\npact of our investment and lending activities and supporting our customers \nin their own transition to a carbon neutral world. \nAt KBC Group we also continue to support the\u00a0UN\u00a0Global Compact\u2019s cor-\nporate governance principles on human rights, environmental protection, \nanti-corruption and better labour practices. We, in particular, focus on three \ndomains where we believe we can help make a significant difference in Bul-\ngaria. Firstly, we seek to enhance the financial literacy of selected, more \nvulnerable parts of the population and to enhance the awareness of cyber \nsecurity and data privacy amongst the general public. Secondly, we deploy \ninitiatives that stimulate a more healthy lifestyle. Thirdly, we seek to stim-\nulate the development of entrepreneurship as a long-term value creator in \nour economy.\nThe common denominator underpinning KBC\u2019s approach is that of behaving \nresponsibly, something we see as core to our company culture. Any busi-\nness today must be judged not just by its financial capital but equally by its \nmoral capital.\nI wish to thank our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners who \nactively engage with us in this common effort.\nPeter Roebben,\nCountry Manager of KBC Group in Bulgaria\nContent\nWelcome to our \nannual Report to Society\nSustainable finance \nprogram\nOur sustainable \nbusiness solutions\nOur people\nOur approach\nContact\nOur recognitions\nthroughout 2021\n\nOur approach\nContent\nWelcome to our \nannual Report to Society\nSustainable finance \nprogram\nOur sustainable \nbusiness solutions\nOur people\nOur approach\nContact\nOur recognitions\nthroughout 2021\n\nThe Belgian KBC Group is the biggest banking and insurance group in Bulgaria.

We launched subsidiaries in Denmark, Sweden, Indonesia, \nTaiwan and Thailand, and welcomed more than 100 new \nemployees. \nThe expansion didn\u2019t stop with the leasing side of our business. \nWe also acquired a leading IT asset disposal company in Germany, \nopened new facilities in Colombia and Spain, and moved to a larger \nfacility in Mexico. All told, we now have 21 IT remarketing and \nrecycling facilities spanning 815,000 square feet \u2013 more than any \nother IT leasing company in the world. We expect to process more \nthan 2 million assets in 2023. This not only helps our customers \nwith a more local solution for environmentally-friendly IT disposal, \nbut also helps multinational businesses by providing a consistent \napproach to IT disposal in more markets around the globe.\nSteve Hamilton\nChairman & CEO\nAll this growth is certainly exciting. But I am also very proud of CSI\u2019s, along with our employees\u2019, \ncommitment to the community. We have done an incredible amount of fundraising and \nvolunteering since our last report. We celebrated our 50th anniversary in a very philanthropic way \nall year long. As a presenting sponsor of the American Cancer Society\u2019s Champions of Hope Gala, \nan event in which I was honored to co-chair, CSI and its employees collectively donated more than \n$200,000 to the cause. Additionally, we spent countless hours planning this spectacular event that \nraised more than $1.37 million to support the Society\u2019s mission.\nWe rounded out our anniversary year with a $50,000 donation to the University of Missouri-St. \nLouis (UMSL) for five Opportunity Scholarships for students from an underrepresented school \ndistrict interested in studying business administration.\nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg. As you will see, we\u2019ve also donated our time and money to \nnumerous causes important to our employees throughout the world.

They are superpowers because \neach expands the impact of the others and together, they are reshaping every \naspect of our lives and work. This goes straight to Intel\u2019s purpose and my own \npassion: creating world-changing technology that touches and improves the \nlives of every person on the planet.\nThat potential impact has never been clearer to me than during this past year. We\u2019ve seen unprecedented \nchallenges, including a global pandemic that brought untold suffering with loss of life and livelihoods, \nheightened social injustice and inequities, and continued impact of climate change. As a technologist, \nI have been inspired to see the collective response to these challenges and the critical role technology \nhas played, from the development of vaccines and new therapeutic treatments in record time, to the \nrapid deployment of online education and learning resources.\nFrom my early days at Intel to today, I have been extremely proud of our company\u2019s long-standing \nleadership in corporate responsibility and sustainability.

In addition, we are \nconvinced that we will continue to \ntake a step in the right direction \nevery day in the future, true to our \nphilosophy:\nTo create durable values, where the \npriority is on uncompromising quality \nand a high level of responsibility for \npeople and the environment, rather \nthan short-term trends.

It may have also just been a keen \nsense for a basic human need \u2013 to sleep \nwell \u2013 that Gertrude and Wilhelm Kremers \nrecognized in 1854. They founded a \nwadding and quilt factory in the village of \nVluyn. To this day, craftsmanship remains \na guarantee of high-quality products.\nThe story of Kremers Paradies bedding \nis defined by numerous pioneering \nachievements. \nThe \npopular \nblankets \nwere initially filled with torn and cleaned \ntextiles or cotton. This was soon followed \nby the development of the first duvet \nfilled with sheep\u2019s wool. Not long after, \nthey impressed their customers with the \nfirst industrially manufactured duvet.\nThis led to a long success story, which \ntook the company to the top in the \ntruest sense of the word: in 1953 the Willy \nMerkl memorial expedition, led by Karl \nHerrligkoffer, was the first to ascend the \nNanga Parbat (Himalayas) from the north \nside. Included in the gear to survive the \nfreezing cold were sleeping bags from the \nLower Rhine, filled with the predecessors \nof the current textile fibers. \nAs John Lennon and Yoko Ono were \ndemonstrating for world peace in a bed in \n1969, the fourth generation of\nKremers \nwas \nensuring \nparadisiacal \nconditions in German bedrooms: with the \ninvention of the first washable quilts, filled \nwith textile fibers.\nWe\u2019re at home on the Lower Rhine, and \nhave been for many generations. The \nheart of our company beats in the tranquil \ntown of Neukirchen-Vluyn \u2013 here, where \nthe horizon is wide and the air is clear.\nThe Lower Rhine is characterized by a \npragmatic and hardworking breed of \npeople. Down-to-earth, always candid, \nand with strong leg muscles, because \nthe bicycle is the transport of choice in \nthese parts. Agriculture and horticulture \ndominate the picture in this rich cultural \nlandscape. Broad fields intermingle with \nlush meadows. The numerous cows \npeacefully lift their noses towards the \nbreeze, while old creeks provide a quiet \nrefuge for flora and fauna. Migrating birds \nare popular guests.\nA region with its qualities, and people that \npreserve and nurture their environment \nand allow it to prosper with an awareness \nof these qualities. For us, it is our obvious \nhome \u2013 it is where most of our employees \nlive, in peace, and always with a view to \nthe next generation.\nEvery day we do our best to distinguish \nbetween good and excellent raw materials \n\u2013 and to use only the best materials for \nParadies bedding. We allow ourselves \nthe claim that we produce impressive \nbedding without compromise. \nThis claim is backed up by the latest test \nmethods and extensive guidelines. While \nour cutting-edge machines can do a lot, \nthere\u2019s one thing they cannot do: replace \nour employees. Their trained eye, attention \nto detail, and skilled craftsmanship make \nthe difference between any old duvet \nand a high-quality Paradies product for \nrestorative sleep.\nWe\u2019ve been producing bedding for \nhealthy and restorative sleep in our \nhometown, Neukirchen-Vluyn, since \n1854.

These reporting standards have not only become \nmore numerous, but they have also become more sophisticated and mature. \nWith this continuously evolving complexity, it can be challenging to identify the most \npopular frameworks and standards for disclosure are and how to best use them to commu-\nnicate your company\u2019s ESG profile to institutional and, increasingly, retail investors. \nWhile the competition between standards has generated significant innovation, it has also \nled to frustration and confusion for those who have not kept up with everything happening. \nTo address the resulting complexity, there have been significant recent announcements \nand efforts from influential players to converge the leading standards into a global, compre-\nhensive corporate ESG reporting system. As these efforts move forward, there will be more \nchallenges for investor relations professionals to predict the probable outcomes to guide \ntheir company disclosures. \nBefore we dive into how the convergence of ESG reporting standards may play out, I \nwant to clarify what I see as a common point of confusion in this market space. This is, ESG \nstandard-setters for sustainability reporting are often confused and grouped into the same \ncategory as ESG data aggregators, analysis providers, ESG raters, and indices. \nFor example, IROs may say they are overwhelmed and confused about which standard to \nuse in their reporting and proceed to ask, \u201cShould we use GRI, SASB, MSCI, Sustainalytics, \nBloomberg, Refinitiv, ISS, DJSI, TCFD, IIRC, CDP, FTSE4GOOD, CDSB, or the CSA? Which \none is most important?\u201d \nIt\u2019s important to remember that while all these organizations and acronyms represent \nimportant players in the ESG ecosystem, they are not all reporting standards and should not \nbe grouped into the same category.\nIt is really important to understand the differences between these players to then be able \nto discuss how to best use them and what the future may look like as convergence and pos-\nsible regulations unfold.\nBelow is a guide to the alphabet soup of organizations and acronyms:\nReporting Standards/Frameworks\n\to\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\to\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\n\to\nInternational Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC)\n\to\nTask Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)\n\to\nClimate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB)\nA review of the alphabet soup \nof ESG standard-setters, data \naggregators, analysis providers, \nESG raters, and indices and reports \non convergence trends that will \naffect ESG disclosure for IROs.\nniri.org/irupdate\nI R  U P D AT E   u   W I N T E R  2 0 2 1     1 3\n\nniri.org/irupdate\n1 4     W I N T E R  2 0 2 1   u   I R  U P D AT E\nThese organizations provide guidance for how a company \nshould disclose ESG information in a public report/disclo-\nsure document. They do not grade, rank, analyze or score \nthe disclosures from these companies, but simply provide \nthe structure for how companies should communicate about \nthese topics to investors and other important stakeholders.\nIn the traditional financial world, compare these to finan-\ncial reporting guidance such as Generally Accepted Accounting \nPrinciples (GAAP), International Financial Reporting Standards \n(IFRS), Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Inter-\nnational Accounting Standards Board (IASB), etc.\nAnalysis Providers/Raters/Rankers\n\to\nMSCI\n\to\nSustainalytics\n\to\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS)\nThese organizations have armies of analysts who read \nthrough your sustainability reports, websites, policies, codes, \nand other public disclosure documents to analyze your \ncompany\u2019s ESG profile; plug it into their models and rating \nmethodologies; and provide scores, opinions, and analysis \nreports to their investor clients.\nIn the traditional financial world, these compare to sell-\nside analysts who also apply a score (buy, sell, hold, etc.) They \nalso compare to credit rating agencies as many of them also \nevaluate risk, issuing ratings such as AAA, BB, etc.\nESG Data Providers\n\to\nBloomberg\n\to\nRefinitiv\nThese organizations also have analysts who read through \nyour public disclosures, but instead of applying analysis, \nscores, and opinions, they supply raw data points on each \ncompany through their platforms (think of The Bloomberg, \nEikon, etc). A sophisticated ESG investor would use this \nraw ESG data to create their own customized methodology \n(selecting the topics that they feel are most material, and/\nor customizing/weighting to the values of their clients) for \nanalyzing companies for investment decisions. \nIn the traditional financial world, these are easy to compare, \nas most are familiar with what Bloomberg and Eikon termi-\nnals o", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

At  \nCarrier, we are well-positioned to make a \nmeaningful difference.\nToday, HVAC systems account for approximately \n40% of a building\u2019s energy consumption, and \napproximately 40% of energy-related global \ngreenhouse gas emissions come from the building \nsector. HVAC contributes an estimated 15% of the \nworld\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, food \nwaste is a significant driver of greenhouse gas \nemissions. If it were a country, food waste would \nbe the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. \nWhen combined, HVAC and food waste contribute \nan estimated 25% of annual greenhouse gas \nemissions. \nCarrier embraces environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) progress through measures \nto improve the planet, people and communities. \nWe play an important role in decarbonizing the \nglobal economy.

Since 2020, the adoption of our \nhigh-efficiency and lower global warming potential \nrefrigerant products as well as avoided food waste \nhas helped our customers avoid approximately \n137 million metric tons of greenhouse gas \nemissions, which is equal to the annual energy use \nof more ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

It follows the requirements of Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB, \nGerman Commercial Code) and Deutscher Rechnungslegungs Standard Nr. 20 (DRS 20, German \nAccounting Standard No. 20). The contents of the combined non-financial statement \u2212 with the \nexception of our carbon footprint, which are marked as unaudited \u2212 are subject to PwC\u2019s audit. \n \n \nIntegrated reporting on non-financial topics \nFor the 2021 reporting year, we have integrated our combined management report and our combined \nnon-financial statement in one report for the first time. This enables our most important stakeholders \nsuch as clients, employees and shareholders to gain a holistic view of our corporate performance. This \nincludes social and ecological topics as well as economic ones. \n \nWhile preparing the report, we followed the recommendations of the International Integrated Reporting \nCouncil (IIRC) for portraying our value creation process (see chart \u201cValue creation process\u201d). Currently, a \nhighly dynamic environment for company reporting exists due to regulatory developments in the field of \nnon-financial reporting and due to a closer cooperation and coordination between the key standard-\nsetters, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB), Task Force \non Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and IIRC. We will therefore continue to develop our \nreporting over the next few years. \n \n \nContents, structure and materiality \nThe information about our net assets, financial position and result of operations is based on the \nrequirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and if applicable, German \nCommercial Code (HGB) and German Financial Reporting Standards (DRS).

On the one hand, the \n\u00adeconomy recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions faster than many people had \n\u00adexpected. But the fourth wave of the pandemic put paid to hopes that the crisis would be over  \nsoon. And central banks stuck to their policies of low interest rates, despite increasing inflation.\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse also went through an eventful year. To come straight to the point: we reported very \ngood results, although external conditions were difficult. Demand for our products and services  \nhad reached record heights in 2020, so the bar for 2021 was particularly high. And in 2021 the  \nmarket environment did not work in our favour. Lower market volatility than in the previous year  \nmeant our trading segments were faced with strong cyclical headwinds. But in spite of these head-\nwinds we achieved our growth and profitability targets. \nThat is further proof of how strong our diversified business model is. We were particularly pleased  \nby the contribution last year from those components of growth that are not subject to the ebbs and \nflows of markets, with secular growth amounting to 6 per cent, principally thanks to our Investment \nFund Services, the rating provider ISS and commodities trading at EEX.\nInorganic growth of 7 per cent was also high. Here the most important factor was the acquisition of \nISS that we completed in February 2021. The purchase expanded the strategic range of our \u00adproducts \nand services. At the same time, it made us a leading provider of ESG data. And in addition to the \ngrowth itself, our move towards more data and ESG has a welcome side-effect: the share of our \n\u00adrecurring income is rising continuously and now comes to 55 per cent. This makes us more indepen-\ndent of the day-to-day market fluctuations.\nThe full takeover of Clearstream Fund Centre also contributed to growth, as well as creating significant \nrevenue synergies. We also completed our acquisition of the Swiss company Crypto Finance AG, which \nfurther improves our position in the blockchain and crypto token space. Together with the introduc-\ntion of G7, our next-generation post-trading platform, this means we set the pace for the technological \ntransformation of capital markets. Which is how we safeguard the future of Deutsche B\u00f6rse. \nAs a result, we achieved our targets for 2021 in terms of both net revenue and EBITDA, with \u20ac3.5 \nbillion in net revenue and EBITDA of \u20ac2.0 billion. Our net revenue has therefore grown by an average \nof 9 per cent and EBITDA by 10 per cent since 2019. So we are well on track to meeting the growth \ntargets defined in our Compass 2023 strategy of 10 per cent for net revenue and EBITDA, respectively, \nby the end of next year.\n3\nExecutive and Supervisory Boards | Letter from the CEO\nManagement report \nFinancial statements and notes\nRemuneration Report\nFurther information\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Group | Annual report 2021\n\nThe decisive contribution comes from our motivated and highly committed teams all around the world. \nOur employees put in an excellent performance in another year dominated by COVID-19. I would like \nto take this opportunity to express my particular thanks to them. \nSo what comes next? To start with, we will continue to implement our Compass 2023 strategy \n\u00adconsistently. And we expect that our cyclical operating environment will continue to improve. That \nshould turn the headwinds into tailwinds for us. We are also pla", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

65\nSUPPORTING THE CHAMPIONS OF ECOLOGICAL GROWTH\n2\nContents\n\n2021 was an exceptional year for investment in the ecological and energy transition sectors, characterized by a\nstrong acceleration: record in amounts invested by investment capital in France (\u20ac2.3 billion), record in\nnumber of supported companies (125), and record in number of exits (more than 10). These are key\nelements revealing the change of scale to be extended in the years to come. Relevant factors for this\nacceleration include the concretization in 2021 of the European Green Deal, as the \u00ab Fit for 55 \u00bb climate\npackage\u2019s main goal is to enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, and the\ntaxonomy regulation providing a common framework to define \u201cgreen\u201d activities, thus steering funds. In\naddition, France has chosen to support companies\u2019 transition towards low-carbon models through the \u00ab\nFrance 2030 \u00bb investment plan, resulting in February in the launch of a \u20ac5.6 billion program to decarbonize\nthe industry.\nThe outlook for 2022 is even more dynamic and the joint support of public and private players together with\ncommitments from players such as ADEME (cf. including the definition of scenarios to reach carbon\nneutrality as described by Arnaud Leroy in his viewpoint page 6) should help to accelerate the development\nof companies in the ecological and energy transition sectors as well as the shift from innovation financing to\nindustrialization financing. Specifically, the year is expected to be fruitful for companies in the circular\neconomy, sustainable agriculture and energy efficiency sectors.\nIn this context, Demeter pioneer and leader in investment for the ecological and energy transition, reinforced\nits dynamism by successfully investing in 19 new companies and reinvesting in 37 existing portfolio companies.\nThis noteworthy performance reflects our expertise, the accelerated growth of our markets and the talent,\ninnovation and know-how of our entrepreneurs.\nOur development dynamics accelerates ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Our \npath to sustainability depends on \nthe empowerment and leadership of \nIndigenous Peoples. We\u2019re committed \nto continue advancing Indigenous-led \nprotection and ecosystem restoration. \nOur \nnew \nrewilding \ncommunities \nprogram will help the National Healing \nForest Initiative create spaces for \nlearning, sharing and reflecting on \nCanada\u2019s history and residential school \nlegacy. We\u2019ll co-produce another land \nback video series.

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "THE PERILS\nOF DEEP-SEA MINING\na briefing for financial institutions\n\n2\nOverview     \nThis briefing for financial institutions (FIs) provides an overview of the nascent industry of deep-sea \nmining (DSM) and the related environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks that it poses. It also \nprovides several actionable recommendations that will allow FIs to avoid exposure to these risks.\nKey findings:\n\u25cf\t The latest scientific research indicates that the environmental damage caused by DSM is \nlikely to be extensive, irreversible and unmitigable.1 DSM risks disrupting the global carbon \ncycle, threatens fisheries and food security, and would lead to irreparable biodiversity loss \nwith devastating consequences for both people and planet.2\n\u25cf\t Biodiversity must be placed at the core of FIs\u2019 ESG strategies; the likelihood of future \ndisclosure requirements on biodiversity is an important risk for FIs to consider given the \ninevitable biodiversity loss that would be caused by DSM. \n\u25cf\t FI involvement with the DSM industry is at odds with compliance with the International \nFinance Corporation\u2019s Performance Standard 63 on biodiversity conservation and the \nsustainable management of living natural resources, due to its adverse impacts on \u201ccritical \nhabitats\u201d of significant importance to (Critically) Endangered and/or endemic/restricted-\nrange species.\n\u25cf\t The future financial viability of DSM is highly uncertain owing to the unpredictable nature \nof future demand for seafloor metals, considerable litigation risk, and the technology being \nlargely unproven at operational commercial scale. Consequently, any financial involvement \nwith the DSM industry by FIs should be considered extremely high risk.\n\u25cf\t DSM\u2019s largest corporate backer, Lockheed Martin, exited the industry in March 2023 following \nthe sale of its UK Seabed Resources subsidiary to Loke Marine Minerals, a Norwegian startup \n\u2013 evidence of major corporations\u2019 increasing reluctance to invest in the DSM industry.4 \nShipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk is the latest major name to divest itself of interests in \nthe deep-sea mining industry, with the sale of its stake in leading DSM proponent, The Metals \nCompany (TMC).5\n\u25cf\t An increasing number of nations are opposing DSM or calling for a precautionary pause or \nmoratorium, including (as of April 2023) Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, \nFederated States of Micronesia, Fiji, France, Germany, New Zealand, Palau, Panama, Samoa, \nSpain, and Vanuatu.6\n\u25cf\t Major companies including BMW, Google, Philips, Renault, Samsung and Volkswagen have \nsigned a statement supporting a moratorium on DSM and pledging to keep DSM minerals out \nof their supply chains.7\n\u25cf\t The growing global movement against DSM, and the industry\u2019s lack of social legitimacy, \npresents a potentially severe reputational risk for FIs who provide support to it. This risk is \nhighly likely to intensify in years to come as public awareness grows of the irreparable and \nfar-reaching environmental impacts of DSM.\n\u00a9 MARUM\nCover image: NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration.\n\n3\nRecommendations to Financial Institutions\nEJF recommends that FIs:\n\u25cf\t\nAdopt and publish policies which explicitly exclude the provision of banking or other financial \nservices8 to:\no\t\nDSM companies, or companies who have a significant share of their revenue or \nactivities within DSM; and\no\t\ncompanies who have subsidiaries (or divisions of the same company) engaged in \nDSM within the corporate group.\n\u25cf\t\nEngage with non-mining companies9 who are potential users of DSM metals to encourage them \nnot to provide support for the industry by: (i) supporting calls for a global moratorium on DSM \nactivities10; (ii) monitoring and tracking where they source minerals for their business; and (iii) \nexcluding minerals/metals obtained from DSM from their supply chains.\n\u25cf\t\nEngage with investors and other sources of DSM funding to encourage them not to provide support \nfor the industry, in line with the conclusion of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance \nInitiative (UNEP FI) that there is \u201cno foreseeable way in which the financing of deep-sea mining activities \ncan be viewed as consistent with the Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles.\u201d11\n\u25cf\t\nExtend their ESG strategy to cover biodiversity (the protection and restoration of nature).\nIn order to action the above recommendations, EJF encourages financial institutions to carry out \nsatisfactory due diligence in order to assess their own exposure (both direct and indirect) to the \nfinancing of DSM activities.12\n\u20ac\nDSM and the risks to financial institutions\nDSM\nrisks for\nFIs \n\u2022 physical disturbance\n\u2022 habitat destruction\n\u2022 sediment plumes\n\u2022 noise & light pollution \n\u2022 fisheries impacts\n\u2022 health & food security\n\u2022 exclusion of\n                             impacted groups\n\u2022 unknown carbon\n                      cycle impacts\n\u2022 uncertain regulatory\n     framework\n\u2022 litigation risk\neconomic viability \u2022\nfuture demand \u2022\nDSM timescales \u2022\ngrowing opposit", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Today, while there is still much more to \ndo, I am pleased to share the meaningful steps we have \ntaken on the journey so far, as we continue to realize our \nbusiness goals and growth. Our ESG pillars \u2013 Respect \nfor Resources, Respect for People & Communities, and \nRespect for Transparency \u2013 are not just the foundational \nstrategy, they are living, breathing processes that hold \nus accountable to fulfill our mission responsibly and \nsustainably.\nFor Digital Edge, ESG has been engrained in our \ncompany\u2019s values since day one. While our company may \nonly be three years old, we are investing in world-class \ntechnology that will create the most efficient data centers \nin the world. Our commitment to energy efficiency, \nethical treatment of our team members and partners, and \ntransparency is in our company DNA. The investments we \nare making will ensure we can live our values \u2013 and meet \nour customers\u2019 needs \u2013 for decades to come. \nThis 2nd ESG report builds on the ambitions we set out \nlast year and outlines the tangible steps we have taken \nor are taking to meet these. We also report for the first \ntime on some key ESG metrics from across our business \nto ensure we can be held accountable for our efforts \nas we continue on this pathway. Below are some major \nmilestones and key highlights from the past twelve \nmonths I would like to draw your attention to: \n\u2022\t Our commitment to our people cannot be overstated. In \n2022, across our construction and operations, we reached \nmore than 2.5 million work hours without lost time injury. \nWe will continue to emphasize the principles of health \nand safety that ensure our people are protected and feel \nsafe in our workplaces. \n\u2022\t We recently opened the doors of our new data center \nin Manila, NARRA1, the largest carrier neutral data center \nin operation in the market. Through this facility Digital \nEdge has become the first colocation operator to deploy \nthe patented StatePoint\u00ae Liquid Cooling technology in \nAsia, which has enabled us to achieve market leading \nPUE of 1.193 or better during the integrated systems \ntesting phase. We hope this facility will set new standards \nfor the region to aspire to when it comes to delivering \nsustainable data centers in hot and humid climates.\n\u2022\t In 2023, we have two facilities - NARRA1 in the \nPhilippines and Edge2 \u2014 on track to achieve LEED Gold \nCertification. There is no clearer demonstration of our \ncommitment to state-of-the-art environmental design \nand build processes than to be awarded this great \nhonor. Going forward, all our new builds will meet, at a \nminimum, LEED Silver standards. \n\u2022\t We are proud to share openly our Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions footprint, beginning our process to manage \nand mitigate our footprint to be carbon neutral by 2030. \nAs a growing company, we know this is an ambitious \nand difficult goal. Having baseline data in Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions ensures we can consistently \nand accurately measure our progress \ngoing forward. \n\u2022\t Digital Edge is dedicated to ensuring our facilities set \nthe strongest possible standards for data security and \nprivacy for our customers and their users. All Digital Edge \nfacilities achieved ISO 27001 standards certification for \ninformation security management systems in April 2023.\nThis is merely a snapshot of the exciting work we are \ndoing to further embed ESG in the Digital Edge way of life. \nWe look forward to your feedback as you read this second \nreport and my door is always open for suggestions and \nideas on what more we can do in the year ahead. While \nwe are still at the beginning of this journey, I am confident \nthat, together, we can put responsibility and sustainability \nat the heart of everything we do and achieve our mission \nto bridge the digital divide. \nSincerely,\nSamuel Lee\nCEO\nCEO Letter\n2\nDigital Edge ESG Report 2023\n\nESG\nReport\n2023\nABOUT DIGITAL EDGE\nDigital Edge is the growth-oriented leader for easy, efficient and \neconomical interconnection across the Asian region.

An earlier mission worked with the Palli Karma-\nSahayak Foundation (PKSF), Economic Relations Division (ERD) of Ministry of Finance (MoF), and other stakeholders to prepare the\nconcept note of the project, which was later agreed with PKSF and endorsed by ERD/MOF in September 2018.\nIFAD experiences in Bangladesh have demonstrated that supporting small farmers to increase agricultural productivity and output has\npositive effects on household income growth, poverty reduction, and food security. Similarly, supporting micro-entrepreneurs to start\nand/or expand micro-enterprises generates income growth, improves food security, and reduces poverty. However, it has become\nclear that fragmented investment in primary production and micro-enterprises, without meaningful integration in profitable value chains\nconnected with expanding markets, does not generate growth of the scale necessary to transform the rural economy and sustainably\neliminate poverty.\nLimited experiences in Bangladesh, and well-documented experiences globally, indicate that successful small farmer and micro-\nentrepreneur integration within commodity value chains with comparative advantage, market demand and growth potential can\nsustainably reduce poverty and food insecurity, improve the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, generate employment\nopportunities in the rural economy, and create broad economic multiplier effects that transform the rural sector. Such value chain\nintegration requires the development of mutually beneficial commercial linkages between small farmers/micro-entrepreneurs and\nlarger-scale consolidators such as private sector agribusiness. Participation of agribusinesses is fundamental to generate demand\nand create markets that reliably absorb output from small farms and micro-enterprises; agribusinesses serve as engines of rural\ntransformation.\nIn light of the above, the project will support small farmers and micro-entrepreneurs (or their organisations) and agribusinesses to\nimprove their operations and integrate contractually within selected value chains. In this perspective, commodity selection is\nfundamental.

This includes reviewing \nregular updates from management on the Company\u2019s sustainability \nperformance, policy updates and targets. \nThe BoD also recognize that the impacts of climate change will \naffect all sectors and future investment patterns. In 2021, we \nwere involved in the Company\u2019s climate risk analysis. The goal is \nto ensure that the company is resilient to physical climate risk, \nchanging market demands and regulatory changes.\nWe would like to highlight that Eidesvik has established ambitious \ngoals to reduce emissions. Eidesvik aims to reduce emission \nby 50% by 2030, and to have a climate neutral fleet by 2050. \nThrough the Company\u2019s ambitious projects, we are positioning \nourselves to reach these goals.

At COP26 the \nnations of the world agreed to uphold or develop new \ncommitments towards a safer global climate, with much \nwork still to be done. In global financial markets, we see \ncontinued progress towards meeting sustainability and \ndecarbonization goals, but also clear signs that we must \npick up the pace of the clean energy transition globally.\nAt EIP, the monumental events of the past year have \nfurther accelerated our mission to lead the transition to \na sustainable energy future while achieving superior, \nrisk-adjusted returns for our investors. In 2021 we \nmade our first five investments from the Frontier Deep \nDecarbonization Fund, our new fund dedicated to investing \nin companies at the forefront of deep decarbonization \ntechnology. We also launched the Elevate Future Fund, our \nfund dedicated to investing in companies that are led by \npeople from underrepresented groups, empower diverse \ntalent, and/or create economic opportunity for underserved \ncommunities. \nOur portfolio of nearly 100 innovations and technologies, \nwhich we believe are key building blocks of the energy \ntransition, has collectively enabled reductions of the global \ncarbon load by more than six million metric tons in 2021. \nWe also fully offset our own carbon footprint, and our 40+ \ncorporate partners have increased their commitments and \ndedication to the energy transition.\nYet we know that we must do more. In addition to \nexpanding our investment platform, we are intensifying \nour ESG-related work with our portfolio companies and \ninvestors, improving the environmental attributes of our \nown workplace, and collaborating much more with peers \nin our industry to advance better impact and carbon \nreporting practices. We have also become a more diverse \nand representative workplace \u2014 approximately 65% of \nthe new hires that we welcomed aboard last year are from \nbackgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented in the \nventure capital and energy technology industries. We are \ncommitted to continue on this path and to help our portfolio \ncompanies improve their diversity and social policies as well. \nTransitioning the world\u2019s energy systems to clean, sustainable \nforms is indisputably one of the most pressing challenges of \nour era \u2014 and one of the largest investment opportunities in \nhistory. We look forward to working with all of our partners \nand stakeholders to make progress towards this goal.\nWELCOME\nPETER FOX-PENNER \nChief Impact Officer\nHANS KOBLER \nChief Executive Officer\nFrom left: Peter Fox-Penner, \nHans Kobler\n\nEIP \u00b7 2022 \u00b7 ESG & IMPACT PERFORMANCE REPORT\n3\nCONTENTS\n4\t\n\u0007Report Overview\n8\t\n\u0007Section One: About EIP\n9\t\n\u0007THE WORLD HAS COMMITTED TO  \nNET ZERO EMISSIONS\n11\t\n\u0007EIP HAS BEEN CUSTOM-BUILT TO ACCELERATE \nTHIS TRANSFORMATION\n18\t HOW WE APPROACH IMPACT & ESG\n23\t \u0007Section Two: Advancing Climate \nSolutions\n24\t CARBON SAVING IMPACTS ENABLED\n31\t \u0007FOUNDATIONAL COMPANY IMPACTS\n39\t CUSTOMER IMPACT KPIs\t\n46\t HELPING OUR PARTNERS SUCCEED\n51\t \u0007Section Three: Case Studies\n52\t \u0007FORM ENERGY: TRANSFORMING THE GRID WITH \nNOVEL MULTI-DAY ENERGY STORAGE\n55\t \u0007ENCHANTED ROCK & SINGULARITY ENERGY: \nCOLLABORATING TO MEASURE CARBON \nSAVINGS\n57\t \u0007PROJECT CANARY: MEASURING & CERTIFYING \nRESPONSIBLY PRODUCED NATURAL GAS\n59\t \u0007MEASURABL: THE LEADING ESG DATA \nMANAGEMENT & ANALYTICS SOLUTION FOR \nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE\n61\t \u0007CHARGERHELP!: RELIABLE & COST-EFFECTIVE \nEV CHARGER MAINTENANCE SOFTWARE & \nSERVICES\n63\t \u0007Section Four: EIP\u2019s Carbon Impact\n64\t \u0007OUR INTERNAL FOOTPRINT\n66\t \u0007SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS\n68\t \u0007OFFSETS & IMPACTS\n69\t \u0007Section Five: ESG\n70\t OVERVIEW\n71\t ENVIRONMENTAL METRICS\n73\t DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION\n79\t ADDITIONAL SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE METRICS\n83\t SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS\n84\t \u0007Section Six: Thought Leadership\n89\t \u0007Carbon Goals Appendix\n91\t \u0007Authors & Acknowledgements\n92\t \u0007Notice for this Document\nIn This Document\n\nEIP \u00b7 2022 \u00b7 ESG & IMPACT PERFORMANCE REPORT\n4\nE\nnergy Impact Partners (\u201cEIP\u201d) \nis a global investment platform \nleading the transition to a sustainable \nenergy economy.

This report outlines \nEnviri\u2019s four ESG focus areas and the Company\u2019s vision and strategy, as well as the importance of the Company\u2019s Values, Code of \nConduct and governance structure in enabling continued success. \nThis report covers the 2022 fiscal year.   \nCONTENTS\n2\nEnviri 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance Report\n\nTHE DECISIONS WE MAKE TODAY WILL DETERMINE \nTHE FUTURE WE HAVE TOMORROW.\nEverything we do today will not just affect our future but also the future of the planet. \nIt is why we believe in doing the right thing \u2013 ensuring that the decisions we are making \u2013 \nday in and day out \u2013 are totally focused on moving us closer to our environmental, \nsocial and governance goals.\n3\n\nI am pleased to share Enviri\u2019s first (and Harsco\u2019s \nfourth) annual ESG Report, charting the \ngoals and progress of our comprehensive \nsustainability strategy.\nAs the largest company supporting the operations of the world\u2019s \nsteelmakers by recycling, repurposing, and reusing slag and as a \nleader in hazardous and non-hazardous waste management in the \nUnited States, we believe that it is our responsibility to treat industrial \nand specialty waste sustainably. We are committed to doing just that.  \nIn June of this year, we changed our corporate name from Harsco to \nEnviri to better reflect what we do and who we are. The reimagined \nlook is designed to communicate our ongoing work to develop \nand refine creative recycling and beneficial reuse methods that \nprovide customers worldwide with solutions to their most complex \nenvironmental challenges. \nWhile there is always more to accomplish on ESG, I am proud of \nEnviri's contributions to making the world cleaner and greener. \n\n\nOf note, in 2022:\n\u2022\t \u0007100% of our revenue came from Enviri\u2019s environmental \nsolutions divisions (continuing operations)\n\u2022\t \u0007Our divisions recycled or reused more than 35 billion \npounds of waste\n\u2022\t \u000787% of slag waste was recycled/reused by our \nHarsco Environmental division\n\u2022\t \u000790% of waste was recycled/reused by our Clean Earth division\nWe accomplished this by becoming a safer company. Our 0.77 Total \nRecordable Incident Rate was a 20% improvement over the prior year.\nWith a new name and a renewed focus on sustainability, solving \nenvironmental challenges facing our customers and the planet, I am \nenergized as we enter this new era. I look forward to continuing to \noperate with the same commitment to excellence that has been part \nof the Company\u2019s legacy for over a century while providing value for \nall stakeholders and the environment.\nF.

As our company has grown, so has our team \nand ability to assess and track our ESG performance, \nidentify areas for improvement and implement strategies \nto achieve our objective \u2013 to become an industry leader \nfor responsible mining and sustainable development. \nOur primary reporting objective is transparency, so all \nstakeholders have a clear understanding of our targets, \nour performance and our efforts for continual \nimprovement. A key focus during 2021 was \nstandardizing data collection and incident reporting \nacross our operations so we can accurately measure \nperformance and identify opportunities for \nimprovement. Those efforts are reflected in this report, \nwhich includes quantitative data on health and safety \nperformance, energy consumption, GHG emissions and \nwater usage. During 2021 we also reported for the first \ntime to the Carbon Disclosure Project, published our \nfirst Tailings Management Overview Report and started \nreporting key ESG data quarterly on our website. \nProtecting the health and safety of our workforce is our \ngreatest responsibility. While we surpassed our health \nand safety targets for 2021, our ultimate goal is to have \nno work-place injuries. A key health and safety initiative \nduring 2021 was expansion of incident reporting and \n\u201cnear miss\u201d reviews. By ensuring that all incidents are \nreported and reviewed, we can identify the cause and \nshare the learnings and corrective actions across our \noperations to prevent recurrence. \nWe also examined our workplace culture and reviewed \nour hiring practices to ensure we are creating an \nenvironment that is welcoming and that our practices \nsupport diversity and inclusion at all levels of the \nCompany. In the fall of 2021 we joined the United Nations \nGlobal Compact Target Gender Equality Program, a \n12-month program that will help us define a long-term \ncompany-wide inclusion and diversity strategy and \nreinforce our culture of inclusivity and respect. \nRespect is one of our core principles and is the \nfoundation of our approach to community \nrelationships.

We buy, maintain, \nand sell the highest quality second-hand \nvessels available. We partner with best-in-\nclass commercial and technical operators \nto ensure our vessels are operated \nefficiently and responsibly. In all we do, we \nare uncompromising in our commitment \nto the highest standards of personal and \nprofessional ethics.\n1\n\nOur 2021 Report\nThe publication of our second annual ESG \nReport reflects the growing importance \nof environmental, social, and governance \ntopics to our company, our industry, \nand the broader business community. \nRidgebury has earned its reputation as \na platform for investors to enjoy strong, \npositive returns in shipping, with the \nassurance that their capital always will \nbe put to work ethically and responsibly. \nWe put that commitment into action by \nproviding transportation that supports \nthe safety and wellbeing of our staff and \ncrew, adheres to local and international \nlaw as well as high standards of ethics \nand transparency, and protects the global \nenvironment. This report provides us the \nopportunity to reflect upon and share our \nprogress.\nThe Year in Shipping \nThree notable developments have shaped \nESG across our industry this year. \nFirst, changes within the public health \nlandscape have reduced (but not \neliminated) the threat of COVID-19, \nresulting in a major relaxation of \nmitigation measures in most countries. \nThis shift has meant that our staff and \ncrews are safer from the virus itself and \nthat our operations can proceed in a more \nnormal and predictable fashion.  \nSecond, the effort to decarbonize \nshipping has gained steam. Major new \nenvironmental initiatives from the IMO \nand EU will come into force next year, and \nmomentum continues to build for ever \nmore ambitious action.\nThird, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine \nhas disrupted the lives of many crew \nmembers. The international response \nto the invasion has altered shipping \noperations. We have proactively taken \nsteps to support affected personnel and \n\u201cself-sanction\u201d Russia by ceasing to do \nbusiness with Russian firms, to carry \nRussian oil, or to call on Russian ports.\nA Role for Ridgebury\nAs a small owner of conventional vessels, \nwe have two main areas of focus. \nFirst, through a combination of capital \ninvestment and unwavering focus on \nfleet performance, we aim to materially \noutperform owners of comparable vessels \nin terms of efficiency and emissions, \nreducing carbon emissions today. Second, \nwe aim to be a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d via \nactive participation in groups focused \non developing and implementing the \nnecessary technological and financial \nframeworks to complete a sector \ntransition consistent with longer-term \nclimate goals, and by investing in these \nnew technologies when they become \ncommercially feasible. \nWhile the composition of our fleet \nchanges from year to year, we \ndemonstrate our progress towards these \ngoals in this report by sharing statistics \non ESG-related topics in line with SASB \nstandards and describing publicly the \ninitiatives we\u2019re taking to keep making \nstrides. \n1 / Introduction\nHew Crooks\nChief Financial Officer\nRobert Burke\nChief Executive Officer\n2\n2 / SASB Disclosure Statistics\nCode\nData\nUnit of Measure\nAccounting Metric\nTopic\nGreenhouse Gas \nEmissions\nCO2 Emissions\nGross global Scope 1\nemissions: operational control\nMetric tons (t) CO\u2082-e\n434,955\nTR-MT-110a.1\nDiscussion of long-term and\nshort-term strategy or plan \nto manage Scope 1 emissions, \nemissions reduction targets, \nand an analysis of performance \nagainst those targets\nN/A\nSee pages 5-8\nTR-MT-110a.2\nAccounting Metrics\n3\nAir Quality\nEcological \nImpacts\nEnergy Consumed\nEnergy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI)\nAnnual Efficiency Ratio (AER)\nTotal energy consumed\nGigajoules (GJ),\nPercentage (%)\n5,630,160\nTR-MT-110a.3\nPercentage heavy fuel oil\nGigajoules (GJ),\nPercentage (%)\n42.4\nPercentage renewable\nGigajoules (GJ),\nPercentage (%)\n0\nMedium Range Class (MR) \nAverage EEOI\nGrams of CO\u2082 per\nton-nautical mile\n16.2\nN/A, voluntary \ndisclosure\nMedium Range Class (MR) \nAverage AER\nGrams of CO\u2082/DWTnm\n6.87\nN/A, voluntary \ndisclosure\nOther Emissions to Air\nNOx\nMetric tons (t)\n11,762\nTR-MT-120a.1\nSOx\nMetric tons (t)\n1,141\nParticulate matter\nMetric tons (t)\n415\nMarine Protected Areas\nShipping duration in marine\nprotected areas or areas of\nprotected conservation\nstatus\nNumber of travel days\n2223\nTR-MT-160a.1\nImplemented Ballast Water\nExchange\nPercentage (%)\n79\t\nTreatment\nPercentage (%)\n21\nTR-MT-160a.2\nSpills and Releases to the Environment\nSpills\nNumber\n0\nAggregate volume\nCubic meters (m3)\n0\nTR-MT-160", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

And through our \nresearch, and the discussion amongst the \nteam that is so central to our approach, we \nconstantly strive to assess all the attributes \nthat make a company a good investment, or \nnot. Where should a company be applauded \nfor its eff orts across E, S and G and where \nis improvement required? How do we verify \nESG corporate reporting and how do we \ncompare the multitude of metrics applied \nin that reporting? \nThese are all frequent topics of discussion \n\u2013 and often spirited debate! \u2013 and we are \nalways happy to share those conversations. \nThis is an area where there are few de\ufb01 nitive \nanswers and constant change.

This is our first publication on ESG-related topics and represents a \nsignificant milestone for us as a company. Social responsibility and corporate \ngovernance have been pillars of our business since our inception. With the \npublication of this report, we cement our commitment to sustainability, and are \nproud to provide a dedicated space to share our progress and ESG-related \nactivities.\nGlobal demand for semiconductors continues to grow, driven largely by demand \nfor electronics such as smartphones and the proliferation of applications \nincluding the Internet of Things and cloud computing. Continued growth is \nexpected with the enhancements of existing products, the introduction of the 5G \nnetworks and the inclusion of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence \n(AI), as well as rapid growth in automotive, electrical and autonomous vehicles \nand industrial electronics. In the face of such demand and the associated increase \nin environmental and social impact, there is a need for all actors in the industry to \ntake meaningful steps towards sustainability. \nCatmek\u2019s systems inspect semiconductor wafers for defective dies and ensure the \nhigh quality of products used by end-users, thereby reducing the costs, waste, and \ngreenhouse gas emissions associated with replacing defective products. \nThis commitment to environmental sustainability extends to our facilities. Our \nmanufacturing process is non-polluting, and we are constantly investing in efforts \nto reduce our footprint, whether that is through optimization campaigns such as \nour recent switch to LED lightning at our facilities, or the installation of charging \nstations on site so we can transition our fleet to hybrid/electric vehicles.\nIn addition to these efforts, we are also steadfast in our belief in the power of \nhuman connections. We have always believed in fair employment and fostering a \npositive working environment, and employees can now enjoy onsite activities \nsuch as HIIT, pilates, or basketball. At our facilities in Israel, the presence of team \nmembers that are well past retirement age is a testament to the strength of the \nbond we all share. \nThis is also the approach we take with our customers. For us, \u2018customers first\u2019 is \nnot just a slogan, and we back it up with comprehensive training, support and \ncustomer service packages.\nFinally, we have longstanding partnerships with our local communities, in Israel \nand around the world. We donate our time and contribute to the economic \ngrowth of our surroundings. A standout part of these activities is our investment \nin education \u2013 our high school training programs and intensive internships for \nstudents.  We believe that by building the next generation of tech workers within \nthe communities where we operate, we are safeguarding their future, and ours.\nRafi Amit\nCEO\n3\nESG AT CAMTEK\nENVIRONMENT\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\n\nAbout This Report\nThis report represents the first sustainability reporting from Camtek Ltd., a publicly traded company (Symbol: \nCAMT) with securities listed on NASDAQ and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE).

Nevertheless, we rolled up our sleeves to continue \nour Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) journey \nstronger than before.\nESG is a key area for cultivating growth opportunities for \ncompanies, managing risks, and leveraging opportunities \nwith the goal of generating value and positive impacts for \ninvestors and communities. We believe that incorporating \nESG in our investment decisions makes our portfolio \ncompanies ready to face future changes and catch linked \nopportunities.\nWithin this document, we describe our responsible \ninvestment strategy and our commitment towards \nintegrating ESG criteria into our business and investment \nprocess. To reinforce our engagement in sustainability, we \nundersigned the six Principles for Responsible Investments of \nthe United Nations (UN PRI) and, by 2023, we will submit our \nfirst PRI questionnaire.\nMeanwhile we are working towards the definition of an ESG \nroadmap that guides our ESG journey, including targets to be \nimplemented through short, medium and long term actions \n(2021-2024) at both asset manager and fund level (ITAGO IV).\nAt asset manager level, we have consolidated a governance \nsystem dedicated to the management of sustainability-\nrelated activities and defined specific ESG objectives (i.e. \ncontribution to fighting climate change and promotion of \noccupational health and safety), in alignment with selected \nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based \non the sectors where our investees operate.\nIn addition, we engaged our Investment Team in a training \nactivity on Regulation EU 2088/2019 (or \"SFDR\") and its \nimplications for ITAGO, and we will periodically review the \nteam ESG training needs.\nAt fund level, we have developed and implemented a \nresponsible investment approach by integrating ESG factors \nthroughout all investment steps, for instance, by introducing \nESG due diligences for all potential investments, and by \nreinforcing our engagement with portfolio companies \nthrough the definition of ESG action plans and an ESG \nperformance monitoring process. To implement this latter, we \nhave introduced an ESG data collection tool that incorporates \nSFDR requirements.\nWe are proud of what we achieved so far and we look \nforward to continuing our ESG path, with the knowledge that \nwe have laid solid bases to seize opportunities for growth.\nLetter from the CEO\nDomenico Tonussi\nManaging Partner\n2\n\nHighlights\nDevelopment \nof an ESG \nRoadmap\nESG Governance \nroles defined\nIntegration of \nESG factors into \npolicy\n100% ESG Due \nDiligence, definition \nof ESG action plans \nand ESG performance\nmonitoring\nITAGO SGR believes that the integration of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) factors into its investment and ownership strategy, \nrepresents a crucial step to identify and support the development of potential and current portfolio companies within the world of Italian \nSMEs.

In \nthe past five years, at least 22 countries in the global south have issued sovereign environmental, \nsocial and governance (ESG) bonds, raising well over US$60 billion. Most international \norganisations view this as a positive development, and the expansion of ESG bonds is now a \ncommon recommendation made in international meetings and agreements on climate and \nbiodiversity. \n \nThis report, therefore, offers a succinct introduction to sovereign ESG bonds and explores some \nof the limitations and risks around the push for ESG financing as a way for global south countries \nto close the financing gap for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate action. It is \norganised into 10 basic questions. The answers to these demonstrate not only the complexity of \nthe ESG bond market but also point to several problems with its expansion. Indeed, the enthusiasm \nfor ESG bonds reflects a highly questionable ideology that promotes private finance as the optimal \nsolution to our multiple global crises. \n \nThis paper aims to serve as a basis for further discussions, particularly within civil society, in order \nto be able to define a well-informed and strategic position. Ultimately, the paper will help Eurodad, \ncivil society allies and policymakers define future actions towards mainstream narratives and \npublic support for expanding ESG financing for global south countries. \n \nRapid evolution of ESG sovereign bonds \nThe growing market in green bonds, first issued in 2007/8, has inspired various \u2018ethically\u2019 labelled \nbonds, such as gender, blue and SDG bonds.

The Reporting Exchange records almost 2,000 \nreporting provisions and other resources that directly or \nindirectly affect the way in which companies report on \nESG matters. While these developments are welcome \nresponses to the challenges of our times, they also mean \nthat companies are facing many choices when deciding \nwhat ESG information to report, how, to whom and where.  \nThe Corporate Reporting Dialogue (CRD) brings together \nsome of the most influential developers of ESG reporting \nframeworks and standards. The CRD is a response to \nmarket demand for greater coherence, consistency and \ncomparability between different frameworks. Members \nare committed to driving better alignment of sustainability \nreporting frameworks, as well as with frameworks that \npromote further integration between non-financial and \nfinancial reporting. \nAs Chair of the CRD, I welcome the ESG Disclosure \nHandbook. It is a valuable resource for companies aiming \nto evaluate the way in which they may use different \nreporting frameworks and standards to achieve effective \nand purpose-driven disclosure. The handbook adopts \nrelevant principles from the professional frameworks that \naccountants use when making and assessing significant \njudgments and providing useful input into ESG disclosure \ndecisions. \nBy providing a structured evaluation process, the ESG \nDisclosure Handbook makes an important contribution to \nenhancing ESG disclosure.  \nIan Mackintosh, Chair, Corporate Reporting Dialogue\n\n ESG Disclosure Handbook 5\n2.\tESG Disclosure Handbook \npurpose and objectives\nIntroduction\nMany considerations affect the decisions companies \nmake about what environmental, social and governance \n(ESG) information they report as well as how and where \nthey should report the information and for which \naudiences. The regulatory and societal context in which \nthe company operates, its stakeholders, ethical choices \nand values and other factors influence the choices \nabout what to report. The absence of universally agreed \nobjectives, standards and thresholds for external ESG \ninformation disclosure means that reporting takes place \nagainst a background of uncertainty. Risks can arise from \nthe failure to satisfy stakeholders\u2019 information needs, \nperceptions of lack of accountability and disconnects \nbetween information reported through different channels. \nCompanies therefore adopt various approaches to ESG \nreporting in practice. These include:\n\u2022\t\u0007Publishing multiple reports aimed respectively at \nparticular subject matter, themes, objectives or \nframework requirements; \n\u2022\t\u0007Integrated reporting that aims to cover all subject matter \nmaterially relevant to performance and value creation, \nincluding increasing the presentation of ESG information \nalongside financial statements and management \ncommentary;1\n\u2022\t\u0007Hybrid approaches based on a range of influences, \nincluding reporting requirements, internal objectives, \npeer practice and/or targets for inclusion in indices. \nAll of these approaches are legitimate responses to the \ndemand for ESG information. However, in many cases it  \nis difficult for users of information to discern why \na company has taken a particular approach, what \nassumptions inform conclusions about the ESG \ninformation reported, and what purpose and audience  \nthe information intends to serve.\nWhat is the ESG Disclosure Handbook \nand who is it for?\nThe ESG Disclosure Handbook offers guidance to help \ncompanies navigate choices associated with ESG \nreporting, including:\n\u2022\tThe ESG information needs of multiple stakeholders;\n\u2022\tMultiple reporting provisions (see Box 1);\n\u2022\tInternal objectives for reporting;\n\u2022\t\u0007External objectives for reporting (e.g., measuring  \nimpact, compliance, etc.);\n\u2022\t\u0007Concerns about repor", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

And in our view, whatever \nthe entity in question, the characteristics of high \nquality reporting and effective communication with \ninvestors are always broadly the same.\nTherefore we believe that you will find this Guidance \nequally relevant to your organisation whether it is  \na large publicly listed issuer with a long track record  \nof reporting; a smaller company; a privately held \nbusiness; or a debt issuer.\nHow investors use ESG \ninformation is changing\nIn recent years, the views of investors in this area have \nmatured significantly. ESG-related information has \nmoved from a \u2018peripheral\u2019 to a \u2018core\u2019 part of investment \nanalysis, across all asset classes1.\nSignatories to the United Nations-supported Principles \nfor Responsible Investment (PRI) now represent $60trn2 \nin assets under management, up from $22trn2 in 2010. \nAlmost all leading institutional investors of UK and \nItalian listed companies are PRI signatories. Recent \nresearch from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance \n(GSIA)3 suggests that sustainable investing strategies \nnow represent more than 60% of professionally  \nmanaged assets for EU investors.\nThe need for issuers to respond to this demand for \ninformation is clear. By disclosing the information that \ninvestors want, issuers can provide reassurance that \nthey are effectively managing business risks and \nidentifying opportunities. There is growing evidence \nthat issuers that publish high quality information on \nthe longer-term implications of ESG for their business \nare more likely to attract and retain long-term \ninvestors4. These issuers can also reduce the cost of \ncapital and increase their ability to raise new capital  \nto finance sustainable projects.\nThe process of reflecting on, analysing and reporting \nESG issues provides important insights into the positive \nand negative implications for financial and operational \nperformance. This also applies to decisions about \nstrategy and capital expenditure.

We believe \nthat this will continue to be the case and that the \nGroup\u2019s model, of helping commercialise cutting-\nedge science, is of real importance, and has and will \ncontinue to have a positive impact.\nScientific innovation has proved to be a vital \nweapon in the world\u2019s response to the COVID-19 \npandemic and some of the companies that the \nGroup has backed and supported over the years \nhave played critical roles in this response. This \ncontribution has amplified the importance of \nbacking innovation in science over the long-term. \nThe pandemic has also presented the world with a \nglimpse of what being unprepared for an existential \ncrisis might look like\u2014a stark reminder of our \nfragility\u2014and this has driven increased interest in \ntackling the global threat of climate change.\nWith COP26 in the UK in November, we are acutely \naware of the need to support the energy transition. \nIP Group is well placed to do this as an investor in \nclean technologies but we will also be focusing on \nhow to manage our own environmental impact and \nthat of our portfolio.\nIn recent years we have articulated this strong \nnatural alignment between the Group\u2019s purpose \nand impact by assessing the impact of our portfolio \nagainst the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals \n(\u2018SDGs\u2019) and have also focused on improving our \nperformance on broader ESG issues.\nA particular focus for IP Group has been achieving \ngreater inclusion and diversity, particularly in the \nGroup\u2019s Senior Leadership Team and we have made \ngood progress with 33% female representation on \nthe Board and 36% female representation on our \nnew Executive Committee whose composition has \nbeen designed to ensure a greater level of diversity \nwith the creation of two \u2018Employee Executive\u2019 roles. \nWe believe we are the first FTSE250 company to \nput such a structure in place.\nThere is, of course, much still to do. The current \npandemic has led to terrible loss of life and \nhuman suffering and has also amplified existing \ninequalities in our society, including systemic \nracism, gender inequality, and poverty. We firmly \nbelieve that IP Group has an important role to play \nin the post-pandemic world, which we hope will \nlook very different another 20 years from now. \nAlan Aubrey \nCEO, IP Group\nCONTENTS\nMessage from the CEO\t\n1\nGroup at a Glance\t\n2\nOur Approach to ESG and Responsible \nInvestment\t\n3\n\t\n\u2013 External frameworks and membership \nbodies\t\n3\n\t\n\u2013 Focus areas\t\n4\n\t\n\u2013 ESG management processes\t\n5\n\t\n\u2013 The Ethics Committee\t\n5\nESG at IP Group\t\n6\n\t\n\u2013 Environmental\t\n6\n\t\n\u2013 Social\t\n8\n\t\n\u2013 Employee and Engagement  \nNon-financial KPI\t\n8\n\t\n\u2013 Key areas of progress \t\n9\n\t\n\u2013 Diversity & Inclusion\t\n10\n\t\n\u2013 COVID-19 response\t\n12\n\t\n\u2013 Community Engagement\t\n13\n\t\n\u2013 Governance\t\n14\nIP Group as a responsible investor\t\n15\n\t\n\u2013 Responsible Investment \t\n15\n\t\n\u2013 Embedding ESG into our investment \nprocesses\t\n15\nImpact at IP Group\t\n16\n\t\u2013 How IP Group and its portfolio map against \nthe Sustainable Development Goals\t\n16\n\t\n\u2013 Measuring progress \t\n16\n\t\n\u2013 Case studies \t\n17\nReporting & Transparency: SASB\t\n23\nReporting & Transparency: TCFD\t\n26\nAppendix: Top 20 portfolio companies\t\n27\n1\nIP Group plc\nESG Report 2021\nINTRODUCTION\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGROUP AT A GLANCE\nIP Group\u2019s purpose is to evolve great ideas into \nworld-changing businesses.

We deeply regret these fatalities and loss, \nand we continue to work hard to achieving zero occupational \naccidents, reinforced by the launch of the \u201cPlayitSafe\u201d program.\nFurther, we are also addressing the vulnerability of people and \ncommunities, through contributions to reducing energy poverty \nand investments in access to energy projects, mainly in Africa, \nhaving committed \u20ac22.5M until 2025. \nGovernance\nIn 2021, we also took steps to further streamline our \ngovernance structure, reaching 40% and 38% women \nrepresentation at Executive Board of Directors (EBD) and \nGeneral Supervisory Board levels, respectively, and making \nfurther efforts in the transparency of gender data reporting. \nWe intend to continue leading by example and were pleased \nto once again be recognised by the Bloomberg Gender \nEquality Index 4. EDP also renewed its EBD\u2019 Remuneration \nPolicy, reinforcing ESG metrics on variable components.\nKey Highlights\n2021 saw an unprecedented global movement of net zero \ncommitments by countries, cities, regions, businesses and \ninvestors. While COP26 con\ufb01rmed \"code red for humanity\" \namidst the IPCC1\u2019s starkest assessment ever, it also kept to \nthe objective to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. \nThe energy transition emerged as the greatest challenge of \nour time, with the High-Level Dialogue on Energy (UN HLDE) \nconvened in September by the UN Secretary General. The \nIEA Net Zero Report signaled a very narrow pathway to \nfulfill net zero, combining renewables, electrification and \nenergy efficiency with adequate policies and further \ntechnological innovation. Greater collaboration and action \nare needed from entire ecosystems, across business, supply \nchain, governments and civil society. \nWe revised our business strategy (BP 2021-25) which now \ncomprises ambitious ESG  targets focused on leading the \nenergy transition, protecting the environment, delivering a \npositive impact on society and maintaining strong \ngovernance. \nWe committed \u20ac24 bn of further investment in the energy \ntransition and we are set to become coal free by 2025 (zero \ncontribution of coal to our revenues by 2025 year-end). \nFurthermore, we plan to be \u201cAll Green\u201d(100% renewables in \nour portfolio), and carbon neutral by 2030 (reducing our \nscope 1 and 2 emissions by 98%).\nThis year we continued to work with our partners and \nrelevant business networks, including the UN, UN Global \nCompact, WBCSD, The Climate Group, We Mean Business, \nSEforALL, on collective projects and initiatives to further \nadvance those topics.\nEDP continues to lead from the front as recognized from \nglobal indexes \u2013we were ranked as the most sustainable \nelectricity company in the world by the Dow Jones \nSustainability Index2 and yet again recognized as one of the \nmost ethical companies in the world by the Ethisphere \nInstitute. \nESG Report 2021\nIn April, we also became part of the S&P Global Clean Energy \nIndex. \nEnvironment\nOur CO2 emission reduction targets were recognized by The \nScience Based Target Initiative (SBTi) as in line with climate \nscience requirements towards limiting global warming to \n1.5\u00baC. \nIn 2021, we reached 19.6 GW of renewable installed capacity \ncorresponding to 80% of our total capacity. We also achieved \n51% reductions in our scope 1 and 2 CO2 specific emissions, \nand 30% reductions in our scope 3 CO2 emissions, compared \nto 2015 levels. We continued to improve our energy efficiency \nproducts and services by offering decentralized PV solutions, \nelectric charging points for E-mobility and helping companies \ncapture opportunities powered by digitalization and \ntechnological advancements. Moreover, we continue to \nreduce our specific emissions throughout the years, with \n2021 figure being strongly penalized by the hydro crisis in \nBrazil, which prompted a high utilization rate of Pec\u00e9m \nthermal plant, dispatched by the Brazilian electricity system \noperator. Nevertheless we reiterate our commitment to \nachieve ~100 gCO2/kWh in 2025.\nIn 2022, we will step up efforts to reduce scope 3 emissions in \naccordance with the latest scientific data, aligned with the \nrecent SBTi 3 Net Zero Standard.\nSocial\nOur sustainability strategy is framed, by the UN\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and is anchored on detailed policies and \ncommitments.

And our long-standing \nguiding principle, the Golden Rule, has \nmeant we have treated each other and our \ncommunities with respect too. We have \nbeen innovating for over 110 years and \nhave taken on the responsibility of leading \nsustainable transformation in our industry.\nWe launched our sustainability strategy, \nOur Responsible Journey, in 2020 and, \ndespite the pandemic, continued to drive it \nforward in 2021. During the disruption and \nchallenges caused by COVID-19, our teams \nand I have drawn strength from this ongoing \nfocus on doing the right thing \u2013 today, and \nin the years ahead.\nWe know our customers love to travel and \nbe active. After the restrictions of the last \ncouple of years, the world is opening up \nagain and there\u2019s a renewed enthusiasm \nand respect for what travel affords us: \nexpansion of perspectives; tolerance and \nunderstanding; reunions with friends and \nfamily; and the sheer joy and appreciation \nof the natural wonders of our planet. In \n2021, as many people made up for a year \nwithout holidays, there was a return to \nmore domestic travel. In the year ahead, \nas vaccine programs help to further loosen \nthe grip of the pandemic, we anticipate that \nglobal travel will pick up again too.\nWe also know that our customers are more \nconscious than ever of the impact they \ncan have on the planet \u2013 and they expect \ncompanies they trust to help them be \nresponsible. We welcome that challenge \nby offering bags and lugage that are \nmade with the environment in mind, and in \nsocially responsible workplaces. I\u2019m proud \nto share with you the progress we have \nmade in the past year, particularly around \nhow we are making our products more \nsustainable. The Magnum Eco \u2013 our range \nof hard-side cases made with recycled \nmaterials \u2013 has set the bar incredibly high. \nWe are also actively exploring how we can \nmake our products easier to repair so their \nyears of service are extended, and how we \ncan help our customers recycle them at the \nend of their useful life.\nThis report also includes updates on our \nwork to reduce the footprint of our own \noperations, and to encourage good practice \nand positive impacts beyond our business. \nIn our chapter about How we are Supporting \nPeople, you can read about how our work \non diversity and inclusion is creating a \nsupportive environment for all our people.\nThank you for your interest in Our Responsible \nJourney.\nYours sincerely,\nKyle Francis Gendreau \nChief Executive\nProducts\nApproach\nEnvironment\nPeople\nPolicies\nData\n\nSamsonite ESG Report 2021 \n2\n27%\n61%\n12%\nNet sales \nby Channel\nDirect to consumer e-commerce\nRetail\nWholesale\nNet sales \nby Channel\n46%\n25%\n17%\n9%\n3%\nNet sales \nby Brand\nSamsonite\nTumi\nAmerican Tourister\nGregory\nOther\nNorth America\nAsia \nEurope\nLatin America\n40%\n34%\n5%\n21%\nNet sales \nby Region\n1%\n8%\n10%\n23%\n58%\n42%\nNet sales \nby Product \nCategory\nTravel\nNon", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

A lot has happened over these ten years.\n\t\n\t\nTen years ago, we \u2013 the Board of Directors and Group Management of Emmi \u2013 decided to \ntake our understanding of sustainability, which had been growing over the decades, and \nformalise it. We created a sustainability mission, with eleven guiding principles to set it in \nthe context of our daily work, and established a sustainability organisation, with committees \non various corporate levels.\n\t\n\t\nTime for a stopover\n\t\n\t\nIn 2016, we went one step further and, for the first time ever, set ourselves specific targets \nfor sustainability work in areas that are particularly relevant to Emmi. The horizon for \nthese targets was the end of 2020. This sustainability report is therefore not only the usual \naccount of the last two years but also an opportunity to review the entire first period of our \nsustainability targets and to take a look at the future.\n\t\n\t\nThe results for the four focus areas of our commitment to sustainability vary. We made a \nsignificant reduction to our own emissions globally. Achieving our own targets is not the \nprimary reason for our happiness \u2013 rather it's the fact that we have been able to embed the \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions into our culture. This is the best possible starting point \nfor future progress. We were also able to foster a shared understanding of how important \nemployees, their knowledge and their development are to the success and progress of our \ncompany. We also reached our first milestone with our most important raw material: milk. \nSince 2019, there has been a Switzerland-wide standard for sustainable milk. Our ambition \nfor waste reduction has failed.

Not least because it is understood and \nsupported by our stakeholders \u2013 especially our employees. We are therefore sticking to \nthis strategy and our focus topics, setting ourselves more ambitious goals and introducing \njust one new topic for the next strategy period: water. Targets with a comparatively short \ntimeframe have also proved successful. They force us to focus and act quickly. In doing \nso, we rely increasingly on the cooperation between networks along our value chain \u2013 for \nexample in our commitment to a circular economy.\n\t\n\t\nOur new 2027 sustainability targets are complemented by our netZero 2050 vision, which we \nsee as a commitment to climate protection that surpasses what at first glance appears to be \na business imperative and, in particular, our direct sphere of influence.

We started as a small watchmaking business and have \ngrown into a diverse portfolio of brands, crafting traditional \nwatches, smartwatches, handbags, small leather goods, and \nmore.

In late 2021, as a part of our \nrebrand to Veris Residential, we introduced Embrace by Veris Residential, under which all our sustainability, \nDE&I, and philanthropy efforts reside. Throughout 2022, Veris Residential and our associates were \nhonored to receive many awards for our team\u2019s dedication to being a responsible owner/operator, further \nsolidifying our company as a leader in ESG.  \nDespite 2022 being our first year participating in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), \nwe earned a 5-Star rating with a score of 88 (out of 100). We were recognized among the highest 20% of \nthe 1,820 participant companies globally and received a GRESB Public Disclosure rating of \u201cA.\"\nWe are proud of all that we have accomplished on behalf of our stakeholders over the past 12 months. \nLooking ahead, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance our properties with amenities that \nmeet our residents\u2019 sustainability-conscious lifestyle preferences, empower our employees with the tools \nthey require to reach their full potential and mitigate our carbon footprint in support of our communities \nand the planet\u2014all while creating value for our shareholders.  \n \nThe Planet \nVeris Residential committed to reducing Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, an objective validated by \nthe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Last year, we shared that we were well on our way to meeting \nthis target, with 2021 Scope 1 & 2 portfolio emissions standing 36% below 2019 levels. Building on \nthis momentum, we are pleased to report that we not only met but exceeded our 2030 goal, reducing \nlike-for-like emissions by 54% as of year-end 2022 (compared to the 2019 baseline). Additionally, we \nsurpassed our goal of reducing our energy consumption by 20% by 2030 well ahead of schedule, cutting \nconsumption by 24% over the last three years.  \nWith these milestones complete, we have been focused on significantly enhancing our disclosure with \nrespect to Scope 3 emissions and are proud to cover more than 90% of our operational carbon footprint \nin our current disclosure. We have also set a new target to decrease our water consumption by 20% \nbetween 2020 and 2030. Further reducing our energy and emissions, as well as water consumption and \nwaste generated, will be largely impacted by our residents\u2019 behaviors. For this reason, and as part of our \nbroader resident engagement program, we have instated green lease amendments across 90% of our \nportfolio, outlining our residents\u2019 commitments to reducing energy and resource consumption.\nWe believe innovation in the real estate industry requires diverse perspectives, and as such, earlier this \nyear, we became a strategic partner to Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for Real Estate \n(MIT/CRE). By combining MIT/CRE\u2019s extraordinary resources and wealth of knowledge in the field with our \npractical, forward-thinking approach to managing multifamily properties, together we hope to research, \ndevelop and implement innovative solutions that advance and evaluate the future of multifamily real \nestate operations. \n \nOur Properties   \nNearly 60% of our managed multifamily portfolio was Green Certified (LEED\u00ae or equivalent) by the end \nof 2022, significantly mor", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Now, responsible investing means being \npart of society\u2019s necessary path to decarbonization, \nwhere we already have industry-leading goals with \nour Science Based Targets and Net Zero commitment \n(see fact box). We are humble to the fact that we have \na big job in front of us to meet our decarbonization \ngoals: emissions reduction will for many companies \nnecessitate operational changes and cooperation across \nthe full value chain.\nWe will continue to sharpen our tools to be able \nto best support FSN portfolio companies on their \ndecarbonization path. We believe that one of our \nmost valuable assets in an uncertain future will be our \nflexibility and openness to adapt, as we together search \nfor the path to reach the bold goals we have set. One of \nour core values - growth mindset \u2013 is required for the \njourney ahead. \nThe private equity industry is in a unique position \nto both capture the investment opportunity arising \nfrom the green transition and to increase the speed \nof the transition by accelerating the growth of such \ninvestments. FSN Capital will continue the race \ntowards Net Zero by investing in companies that \ncan contribute to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions in a material and quantifiable way, such as \nObton and newly signed Polytech.\nAs always, we will do this with our Ultimate \nClients in mind: the millions of workers, students, \npensioners, and other citizens around the world, to \nwhom we aim to deliver attractive investment returns \nin a responsible way.\nThis year\u2019s report marks a milestone for our firm: \nfor the 10th time we are transparently documenting \nhow we choose to incorporate ESG into all stages \nof the investment process. As we work on meeting \nour bold goals, we will continue to report to our \nstakeholders on our progress, in the open and \ntransparent manner we have strived for since 2013.\n\u201cWe must all have the courage to set \nbold targets and work steadfastly \ntowards them.

Many of the persistent \nchallenges that humanity has faced during this period \nrequire continued attention, including combating climate \nchange, preserving natural resources, fighting COVID-19, \nand narrowing the digital divide. We are all learning to live \nwith the new reality created by these challenges that \ncontinue to cause broader concerns about peace and \nprosperity for all.\nThis rapidly changing context urges the global business \ncommunity to respond with smarter innovation and more \nresponsible operations, seizing every opportunity to act \nwith a larger purpose in mind. Business practices need to \ncomply with laws and regulations as well as high ethical \nstandards and moral imperatives. Lenovo is committed to \nour vision to provide smarter technology for all and \nhelping to decarbonize the global economy \u2013 one of \nhumanity\u2019s greatest challenges. With that, I am proud to \nshare our environmental, social and governance progress \nover the past year and our goals for the future.\nEnvisioning Net-Zero by 2050\nLenovo is fully committed to carbon footprint reduction in \nits operations. After exceeding our 2020 carbon emissions \nreduction target, we have set a vision of achieving \nnet-zero by 2050, and we are working with the Science \nBased Targets initiative to determine the goals that \nsupport this vision.\nFrom an innovation perspective, our Neptune liquid \ncooling technology, combined with our High-Performance \nComputing cluster, helps data center customers become \nmore energy efficient. For example, they enable our \ncustomer, DreamWorks Animation, to cut power \nconsumption by a third while increasing the amount of \ncomputing power per square foot of its existing data \ncenter by more than a hundredfold, which creates a \nreal-time rendering process for creative artists.\nLenovo has continued its focus on resource preservation \nand supporting a circular economy by increasing the use \nof recycled and recyclable materials in packaging, \nincreasing the use of bio-based materials, reducing the \nsize of packaging, and expanding the use of bulk and \nreusable packaging solutions that help to reduce carbon \nemissions. Since 2012, we have been using bamboo fiber in \npackaging, a renewable, bio-based and lightweight \nmaterial. We have continued to increase our use of this \nmaterial, and are now using it in the packaging for more \nthan one million products each year. In FY 2021/22, we \nexpanded our use of bamboo fiber to include the \nThinkPad X1 and Z series gift boxes, thus reducing the \ntransportation weight by 30 percent.\nWe have continued to expand Lenovo\u2019s renewable energy \ninstallation as we work to achieve our energy-related \ntargets. The total in-operation renewable energy capacity \nin our worldwide locations has now reached \napproximately 17 megawatts, with more in the plan.\nFurthermore, our efforts to effectively engage with \nsuppliers on climate change were acknowle", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Looking back on the \nacademic year, I could not be prouder of the accomplishments and contributions of our \nteam in advancing knowledge and practice in the realm of family business.  \n \nAround the world, 2021-22 offered some breathing room and a space to slowly regain a \nsense of balance and normalcy after two challenging years. As the year progressed, \nwe were happily offered greater opportunity for face-to-face interactions with students, \nalumni, scholars and family-business leaders.  \n \nThrough the distinct lens of family business, we leveraged our online communication \nplatforms to showcase the team\u2019s distinct areas of expertise: Pascual Berrone shed \nlight on strategy and sustainability, Alfonso Chiner examined governance and family \nvision, Heinrich Liechtenstein shared insights on family purpose and philanthropy, \nJeroen Neckebrouck explored entrepreneurship, investor strategy and diversity, and \nJosep T\u00e0pies shone a spotlight globalization, succession and ownership strategy.  \n \nFor my part, social responsibility, stakeholder relations and corporate governance were \nthe focus. Working together, we aimed to bring Aristotle\u2019s words to life by interweaving \nthese singular threads into a rich tapestry of knowledge on family business. \n \nAs we look ahead, we will continue to address the evolving challenges and hot-button \nissues facing family-controlled firms, as well as emerging global trends \u2013 sustainability, \nESG-focused leadership and ongoing digitalization, among them \u2013 and their specific \nimpact on family business.  \n \nIn this regard, our sincere gratitude to Cegid-Meta4 \u2013 now a partner of IESE\u2019s Chair of \nFamily-Owned Business following 10 years of institutional support \u2013 and our heartfelt \nwelcome to Caser, which recently joined to support research on the unique \ncontributions of family-controlled firms to both their stakeholders and society at large. \nLastly, our thanks to you, dear reader.

Changes \nbrought about from environmental, financial, technological, and political \ndevelopments have underpinned the need for organizations to be agile to \nface challenges and thrive. Organizations have the opportunity to adapt, \nreinvent themselves, and embark on new initiatives. At Globant, reinvention \nis central to what we do. It\u2019s why we exist. We believe that the success of \nany company is rooted in its ability to reinvent itself. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been \nenabling reinvention for our clients through intuitive and agile technologies \nthat help them create a way forward into a sustainable future.\nI\u2019m very happy to connect with you again today and share our annual results. \nIn 2021, we became a billion-dollar-revenue company for the first time \nand delivered a 59.3% year-over-year growth. This is the strongest annual \nrevenue growth since our Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2014. But even \nmore importantly, it affirms that our clients trust in our work and our team. \nOur amazing team of Globers grew by 45% year-over-year. We are now a \nglobally cohesive team of more than 23,500 creative minds, serving more \nthan 1,100 blue-chip clients around the globe.\nHere\u2019s probably the most important message that we can convey to inspire \nothers to take action: Why do we do all this? Simply because we care about \nmaking the world a better place, one step at a time. That is the greater \nreason behind everything we do, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so passionate about \nour mission.\nWe care about  growing  our clients\u2019 businesses and making them \nsustainable over time. Some of the most beloved brands in the world \ncount on us to help them solve their most complex challenges and strongly \nrecommend us. Globant\u2019s Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures how \ncustomers perceive our quality of service, was 64 for the past 12 months. \nAvailable industry benchmarks are generally between 30 and 40.  \nLetter from the CEO\nWe care about the environment. In 2021 we became a carbon-neutral \ncompany, and we committed to continue reducing our environmental \nfootprint in line with Science-Based Targets. We are there now because we \nbelieve it is important, and we have the mission to help our clients reinvent \nthemselves to be protagonists in a low-carbon economy era.   \nWe also care about our communities. That\u2019s why we have inspired and \ntrained more than 8,000 people around the globe in STEM fields. We work to \nprovide opportunities to as many as possible, building the bridge between \ntechnology and our communities. Also, we renew our commitment to the \nUN Global Compact.\nFinally, we care about our people. Our value system is rooted in mutual \nkindness and guides how we look after our people. Globant continues to \nmake inroads on the path to gender parity as we continue our commitment \nto 50% of our managerial positions to be held by women and non-binary \npeople by 2025. We promote D&I, learning and development, and work/life \nbalance. \nWe are proud that the global community has recognized these efforts and \nour commitments through more than 45 awards in 2021. Our company was \nincluded in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook as our ESG metrics are \nwithin the top 15% of the industry. Additionally, Brand Finance has ranked \nGlobant on its list of the Top 10 Strongest IT Services Brands globally, \nshowing an estimated 31% growth in Globant\u2019s brand value in the last year.\n2021 was an amazing year, and now it\u2019s time to continue delivering our \npassion for innovation over the years to come.

Initially, the VEE was supported by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna and \nBudapest and then later by the Schools of Veterinary Medicine in Alfort and Lyon. \nBetween 1921 and 1948 the VEE was included in the University of Bucharest, and since 1948 \nbecame a part of the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest \n(UASVMB). Currently, it is one of the 7 faculties within the UASVMB. \nDue to activities under the old communist regime, the central VEE campus was disbanded between \n1985 and 1990 and the education of the veterinarians transferred elsewhere. However, after the \n1989 Romanian Revolution, the campus was recovered. The renovation of the historical buildings \nbegan in 1990, and currently, the campus is being upgraded, including the construction of a \nUniversity Emergency Hospital / Veterinary Teaching Hospital (UEH / VTH), the only one of this \ntype in Romania, with 24/7 services, and a University Centre of Experimental Medicine (UCEM), \nwhich started to operate since February 2020. \nIn Romania there are 5 Faculties of Veterinary Medicine, of which 4 are state-funded and public \nand one is private. FVMB is one of the 4 public faculties, along with those in Cluj-Napoca, Iasi \nand Timisoara. \n \n\nFINAL REPORT AS ISSUED BY ECOVE ON 8 JUNE 2022 \n3 \n \nPrevious ESEVT visits \nIn June 1999, the VEE was the subject of an EAEVE Consultative Visitation, which, although \nfinding some positive aspects, indicated a series of deficiencies. In 2000, the VEE underwent a Full \nVisitation, the outcome of which also indicated a number of deficiencies were still evident.

UVMB has a long and interesting history from its foundation in \n1787 when the first department of veterinary medicine was formed at the Medical Faculty of \nthe University of Pest. Until 2000 it was a sovereign veterinary university and at that time \nbecame a Faculty among 6 other faculties within the Szent Istv\u00e1n University. UVMB became \nan independent university again on the 1st of July 2016. \n \nUVMB became a \u201cFoundation University\u201d in August 2020, with the Marek J\u00f3zsef Foundation \n(MJF) replacing the Ministry for Innovation and Technology (MIT) as the overall governing \nbody. The education activity is financed from both state subsidies and tuition fees. \n \nUVMB was first evaluated by EAEVE in 1995 without major deficiencies and, after \neliminating two deficiencies in 2004, has remained approved. The last EAEVE visitation took \nplace in February 2014 resulting in accreditation. In addition, the Hungarian Accreditation \nCouncil (HAC) accredited UVMB in June 2023. \n \nMain features of the VEE \nThe Faculty graduates veterinarians for the Hungarian society but it also teaches in German \nand English, therefore delivering veterinarians for the European and wider societies. In addition \nto the veterinary medical training programme, UVMB also has EBVS residency programmes, \nand several other continuing education programmes.  Approximately two thirds of students \nparticipating in the foreign-language programs come from 65 countries. \n \nThe main campus of UVMB, is located in the central area of Budapest, while some departments \nand units can be found on satellite campuses near the Teaching Farm (TF) in \u00dcll\u0151 (35 km from \nthe main campus) and the artificial insemination centre in Martonv\u00e1s\u00e1r (40 km).  \n \nMain developments since the last Visitation \n\nFINAL REPORT AS ISSUED BY ECOVE ON 11 DECEMBER 2023 \n3 \nThe Self Evaluation Report (SER) lists a plethora of changes since to last ESEVT evaluation \nwhich can be accessed under the following headings: \n\u2022 Major organisational changes \n\u2022 New buildings and major items of equipment \n\u2022 Main changes to the academic programme \n \nVersion of the ESEVT SOP which is valid for the Visitation \nThe ESEVT SOP 2019 as amended in September 2021 is valid for this visitation. \n \n \nArea 1: Objectives, Organisation and QA Policy \n \nStandard 1.1: The VEE must have as its main objective the provision, in agreement with \nthe EU Directives and ESG recommendations, of adequate, ethical, research-based, \nevidence-based veterinary training that enables the new graduate to perform as a \nveterinarian capable of entering all commonly recognised branches of the veterinary \nprofession and to be aware of the importance of lifelong learning.  \nThe VEE must develop and follow its mission statement which must embrace all the \nESEVT Standards. \n \n1.1.1. Findings \nThe university has clearly defined its mission in the field of education, research and clinical \nactivity in the veterinary field in the Mission statement document (https://univet.hu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2022/09/K%C3%BCldet%C3%A9snyilatkozat_2022_ENG.pdf), \nto \nmeet \nboth domestic and international demand of professionals and linking its lines of action to ESG \nstandards.

The RFI Foundation joined to share input on the considerations\nfor the industry. The Summit chairs then opened the floor to the delegates to gain\ntheir insights.\nPRESENTATIONS:\nMichel Rauchs,  CCAF\n\u25cf\nCovered the challenges of making a robust assessment of the carbon footprint\nof crypto, including the fact that most estimations are taken at one point in\ntime\n\u25cf\nThere are three steps to creating a robust assessment of carbon footprint,\neach of which is a significant component on its own:\n1.\nPower consumption: continuous estimates of how much Bitcoin is\nmined\n2.\nHashrate: where is the mining located? Both the country and at a\nregional level, on a continuous basis\n3.\nLocal power mixes and average carbon intensity of every local source\n\u25cf\nLooking to improve collaboration with miners in their research\n\u25cf\nOpen questions for industry:\n\u25cb\nModel assumptions: we need data on the hardware model makes\n\u25cb\nMethodological trade-offs: looking to make sure that we capture\noff-grid mining too\n\n\u25cb\nCCAF are looking to approach other assets and networks beyond\nBitcoin\n\u25cb\nNeed to look at further scope 2/3 emissions - understand the value\nchain, where derivatives fit in, how liable is an exchange, .etc.\nBlake Goud, RFI Foundation\n\u25cf\nWe need to consider the near- and long-term goals. 2050 may seem far off,\nbut there will be a global stock take in 2023, and new targets expected to be\nset in 2025\n\u25cf\nWe need to define the boundaries around what we can account for in carbon\nemissions - set the scope throughout the value chain\n\u25cf\nScope 3 includes investments: how much are digital assets being used in\nsustainable investments\n\u25cf\nConsider the additionality of doing something with digital assets vs traditional\nforms of banking\nROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION:\nParticipants:\nMartha Reyes, Head of Research, Bequant\nFrederik Gregaard, CEO, Cardano\nLaura Douglas, Senior Associate, Clifford Chance\nMark Blick, CEO, Diginex ESG\nHarry Hughes,  Chief of Staff, Eqonex\nTanya Woods, General Counsel, Hut8 Mining\nRichard Peers, Founder, Responsible Risk\nDr. Peter T.

GDF should convene standardized indicators\nthat companies should be reporting on, and develop the industry-wide\n\nstandard for ESG reporting. There is a lack of standards or best practices\navailable for miners in this space.\n\u25cf\nDespite the complexities, we must remember that compared to other\nindustries/other sectors, we are in a stronger position as we are focusing on\nelectricity consumption: the supply chain is in many ways simpler, and the\ndata is there if we share it.\n\u25cf\nWe need to collaborate and be honest with our successes and failures, and\nhold each other accountable. We are either all winners or we are all losers in\nthis space. There is no competition to be had.\n\u25cf\nOur biggest risk is our own public perception of energy use. Until we show\nthat we are taking it seriously and taking action, there is a huge risk that the\ngeneral public will not see beyond this problem.\n\u25cf\nWe must take the G and the S seriously too, throughout the supply chain.\n\u25cf\nNeed to think longer term about where we are heading, rather than simply\nwhere we are today: If we were to replace traditional finance, what would our\nenergy usage and environmental impact be?\n\u25cf\nChristmas lights at times have bigger environmental impact than the crypto\nindustry.\nCommunity approach and initiatives:\n\u25cf\nThis community responds quickly and actively to internal and external\npressures, and is highly engaged on this already. The user base wants\nimprovements, especially on waste issues. They are extremely aware of the\nimpact of crypto, perhaps even more so than institutional investors.\n\u25cf\nThe recent narrative has sent our community into rapid discussion and\ncollaboration.

Through-\nout our history, the firm has always grown sustainably. Our growth can be \ndescribed as sustainable because it has been steady, continuous and always in \nthe interests of our clients.\nOur firm has consistently promoted a strong social and interpersonal collab-\norative environment, which is also reflected in our corporate culture. Twen-\nty-five years ago, the concept of environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nwas not attributed the same significance it has today. Now, ESG is an indispen-\nsable element of day-to-day business for companies and professional services \nfirms. Following new EU regulations, the capital market and many businesses \nare having to take a closer look at sustainability than ever before.\nLast year, we laid the foundation for our transparency regarding ESG by pub-\nlishing our first ever sustainability report for the year 2021. In doing so, we \nalso showed how motivated we are to contribute to the sustainable transfor-\nmation of the economy and society as a service provider. The overwhelmingly \npositive feedback we received for the report shows how important this issue \nhas become.\n \nWe see sustainability as an ongoing process that involves continuously devel-\noping measures and policies and thus successively integrating new aspects \nof ESG into the firm\u2019s business operations and processes. This Sustainability \nReport 2022 presents the milestones both big and small that we achieved in \nthe previous year on our way to becoming a more sustainable firm.\nThis report focuses on the most significant innovations and changes for the \nyear 2022. Unsurprisingly, one recurring theme is our guiding principle \u201cYour \nperspective.\u201d When it comes to environmental and social issues, our actions \nare influenced not only by the motivation of our employees, but also the dia-\nlogue with our clients and other stakeholders.

Amid renewed and challenging lockdowns, \nmanagement has been able to ensure the continued \nsupply of testing kits to our customers while \nkeeping staff safe. All staff are proud of the role \nthat Genetic Signatures has played in providing \nthe diagnostic tools to help limit the spread of \nCOVID-19. I personally would like to commend each \nmember of the Genetic Signatures global team for \ntheir dedication in performing their unique role in \nensuring the Company\u2019s critically important tests \nhave contributed to the safety of the community in \nthe ongoing period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHopefully, increasing vaccination rates will help \nsupress COVID-19. But with elimination of the SARS-\nCoV-2 virus increasingly difficult to achieve in the \nshort term, citizens globally are likely going to have to \ncoexist with the disease in one way or the other and \nthis would imply strong ongoing demand for regular \nstreamlined testing.\nTo date, more than three million Genetic Signatures \ndiagnostic tests of all types have been undertaken on \npatient samples. Based on our proprietary 3base\u2122 \ntechnology and sold under the EasyScreen\u2122 brand, \nthese tests can detect groups of organisms \u2013 up to \n20 at a time \u2013 from the one patient sample.\nWhile SARS-CoV-2 has been a contributor to the \ngrowth in revenue and overall financial performance, \nGenetic Signatures continues to focus on the \ndevelopment of its broader testing capabilities. \nWork continues on several new products that are \nat different stages of development, to supplement \nthose products that have already received regulatory \nregistrations in various global jurisdictions. This \ninvestment in R&D programs is targeting multiple \nnew revenue opportunities. \nFor example, European authorities registered the \nEasyScreen\u2122 STI/Genital Pathogen Detection \nKit during the year, which now brings to five \nChairman\u2019s Letter\n\n5\nEasyScreen\u2122 detection kits available for sale in \nEurope and UK. An application to the Therapeutic \nGoods Administration (TGA) for STI kit registration \nwas also lodged and is currently pending approval.\nAdditionally, clinical trials in the USA for the Enteric \nProtozoan test kit have continued to advance to \nsupport an application to the US FDA to be able to \nsell this product in the largest molecular diagnostics \nmarket in the world.\nOverall, Genetic Signatures had made great strides \nsince its ASX listing in March 2015. Sales have \nincreased from $1.8m in the first year of listing to \n$28.3m this financial year, and as reported in July, a \nvery strong start to FY2022 sets up your company for \nthe year ahead. \nPerhaps not surprisingly, recent interest in - and \nunderstanding of - molecular diagnostics has \nincreased markedly as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 \ntesting opportunities. \nI would like to recognise the outstanding \ncommitment and stewardship of our Board.

In my \nfirst year as Chair, I have drawn great confidence from the disciplined \napproach to governance at Pearson, and the high calibre of our \nBoard members. Their expertise and integrity have helped to cement \nour strong financial position in 2022 and to advance our purpose: to \nadd life to a lifetime of learning.\nStrategy and performance \nThe Board has been heavily engaged with the management team in \noverseeing the implementation of our growth strategy, with a \nparticular focus on embedding operational discipline around the new \nbusiness divisions. This has helped to \u2018right-size\u2019 the business and \nachieve significant efficiencies that have accelerated our margin \nimprovement expectations.\nA highlight of 2022 was the completion of the first year of Pearson+. \nWith 4.8 million registered users in that full calendar year, it is an \nimportant milestone in our journey to realise a digital ecosystem for \nlifelong learning. Developing our workforce skills strategy has been \nanother priority for the Board in 2022. With more than 2,000 \nenterprise learning clients, it is the next big opportunity for Pearson \nto support employers and employees through Assessment & \nQualifications, Workforce Skills, and English Language Learning.\nThe Board also continued to reshape and refine Pearson\u2019s portfolio \nin support of our strategy through both acquisitions and divestitures. \nIn 2022, we acquired consumer language learning app Mondly, a \ncornerstone of our direct to consumer approach in English Language \nLearning \u2013 you can read more about this acquisition and the Board\u2019s \nconsiderations in relation to it on page 69. Another consumer-\nfocused acquisition was the digital credentials platform Credly, \nthrough which we are tapping into the vast and growing focus for \nlearners to be able to evidence their achievements and progress \nthrough digital certification. It is also valued by employers to \nencourage skills development in their workforces and has issued \nmore than 50 million credentials, with some 70,000 new joiners a \nweek. Additionally, the Board oversaw the sale, through a number  \nof transactions, of much of our K-12 publishing businesses in \ninternational markets.\nThe Board was instrumental in assessing and responding to three \nunsolicited takeover approaches to the company from investment \nfirm Apollo Global Management. After careful consideration, the \nBoard voted unanimously to reject the approaches as we believed \nthey all significantly undervalued the company. We thank you, our \nshareholders, for your support in the Board\u2019s position. \nThe Board continued to pay close attention to maintaining a strong \nfinancial position, which enabled us to increase the dividend in 2022, \nin line with our progressive dividend policy. We were also able to \nlaunch a \u00a3350m share buyback programme, while remaining well \nplaced to pursue strategic opportunities as they arose, such as the \nannouncement in December of our proposed acquisition of \nPersonnel Decisions Research Institute (PDRI), which we look forward \nto completing subject to receiving the relevant clearances. \nAs part of monitoring execution and performance, the Board \nregularly receives a dashboard that allows Directors to monitor \nprogress on Pearson\u2019s financial and strategic priorities, supported by \nagreed indicators and milestones identified as key measures of \nperformance. While we work to embed the strategy, we will continue \nto refine this dashboard to ensure it includes the right key \nperformance indicators (KPIs) to monitor our progress. You can read \nmore about those KPIs on page 18 of this annual report.\nThe Board\u2019s oversight of performance and risk is underpinned  \nby the excellent work of our Audit Committee, which you can read \nmore about on pages 80-87, including a number of strategic risk \ndeep dives and a particular focus on data privacy and cyber security, \nas well as overseeing the important matter of our external audit \ntransition in 2022.\nSustainability, stakeholder engagement and culture\nAs the world\u2019s leading learning company, Pearson recognises its \nenormous potential to make a positive impact on people and the \nplanet, as outlined in our environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nframework, which you can learn more about on page 30. The \nReputation & Responsibility Committee has primary responsibility for \nmonitoring and inputting into Pearson\u2019s sustainability strategy and \ninitiatives on behalf of the Board, with more on this described in the \nCommittee\u2019s report starting on page 78.\nUnderstanding the views and priorities of all our stakeholders is key \nto running a successful, sustainabl", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Introduction\n4\n5\n\nAt HMC Group, we are committed to crea-\nting a brighter, healthier future for patien-\nts, communities and our planet.\nSustainability has been at the center of HMC Group\u2019s \nobjectives for years. At the beginning it had an emphasis on \nenergy efficiency, evolving to include environmental and so-\ncial issues in a more systematic way. Raising awareness of \nthese concepts increased following the earthquake that hit \nMirandola and the surrounding areas in 2012. During the re-\nconstruction period, HMC\u2019s priorities changed, we focused \non industrial and energy efficiency. This represented both a \nbusiness necessity, to create a competitive production mo-\ndel with low environmental impact, and a business imperati-\nve for a company with a high energy consumption like ours.\n2022 was the year we embarked on our true transformation \nby fully embracing sustainability. We have understood the \nimportance of acting in this direction and, starting from \nsmall daily gestures, contributing to improving the corpora-\nte impact. \nWe want to embark on a virtuous path with humility but also \nwith the ambition of being able to do our part for a better \nfuture. We know and firmly believe that a company must lea-\nve positive footprints along its path. Therefore, in December \n2022, we proudly made a sustainability commitment, beco-\nming one of the first Benefit Companies in the biomedical \nsector. Our declared commitment focuses on four key areas.\nHealth - We help health.\nImproving personal care, the health and well-being of patien-\nts at the time of illness and the quality of life in hospital \nfacilities.\nPeople - We help people.\nImplement concrete programs that concern the well-being, \nwork-life balance, home-work, travel and professional \ngrowth of our workers.\nCommunity - We help the community\nTo be a sustainable business model along the supply chain \nby helping to give value to the wealth of internal knowledge \nand skills and of the production district, thus supporting the \ndevelopment of local communities and the reference terri-\ntories.\nThe planet - We help earth.\nRespect environmental resources by reducing and contai-\nning the environmental impact of our activity. With this, our \nfirst Sustainability Report, we formalize and begin our long-\nterm commitment and measure what has been done in past \nyears. \nI would like to express thanks again to my father and all my \ncollaborators.

Sustainability requires special \nattention, because Haarslev is the global leader in \nmanufacturing equipment for the rendering industry. We \nare determined to embrace our global responsibilities, \nand we want to contribute to a better tomorrow for this \nworld.\nThe past year has been eventful and demanding for \nmany, with the world on its way out of the grip of \nCovid-19. We\u2019ve faced inflation, supply chain problems \nand \u2013 not least \u2013 the first war in Europe in eighty years. \nThe conflict between Ukraine and Russia has given \nHaarslev particular challenges, due to several projects \nwith Russian customers.\nFrom the very beginning, Haarslev made sure we \nwere fully compliant with all relevant embargoes \nand sanctions. Projects were firmly managed and \nimplemented, with special attention paid to embargo \nrequirements, as well as to contractual agreements with \ncustomers. There may have been certain legal avenues \nfor continuing some operations on Russian soil, but \nHaarslev decided to uphold our beliefs and values, and to \npull out of the Russian market to comply with these.\n2022 was also the year in which Haarslev welcomed me \nas the new CEO, and in which I took on the challenge of \nbringing Haarslev to the next level.

Our par\u00ad\nent institution\u2019s ESG heritage dates back to \nthe early 1990s, with a demonstrable record \nin responsibility and a pioneering engage\u00ad\nment service. Since Hermes Infrastructure\u2019s \nestablishment in 2011, we have continued to \nbuild on these strong foundations. \nThe public-service nature of infrastruc\u00ad\nture assets demands the highest standards of \nESG are adhered to. The long-term nature \nof the assets, the wide range of stakeholders \ninvolved, including large workforces, as well \nas the interaction with the natural environ\u00ad\nment, all mean that a portfolio company\u2019s \napproach to tackling ESG matters will im\u00ad\npact the prospects and long-term value of \nthat business. We place a strong emphasis \non governance, because we really believe \nhaving a robust governance framework bet\u00ad\nter equips a company to positively address \nits environmental and social responsibilities. \nAs an infrastructure manager, we have a very \nclear responsibility to our investors, to so\u00ad\nciety and to the businesses we invest in, to \nensure that these issues are addressed in a \nsustainable way. \nQ\nIs sustainable infrastructure \ninvestment primarily about \ntackling climate change?\nOver the past few years, the ESG debate \nhas been somewhat redirected towards the \nclimate change crisis. While this has risked \nlowering the priority of other aspects of \nESG, it has actually led to several concrete, \neasy-to-implement actions across the indus\u00ad\ntry, with clear and immediate benefits. In our \nportfolio, this has led to a change in energy \nmix and consumption patterns and improved \nwaste optimisation strategies, benefiting the \nenvironment and cutting costs. \nThere is, however, still a lot to do on the \nsocial aspects of ESG. Issues can be quite \nlocalised, making it more challenging to \ndevelop a common language around how \nbest to bring these considerations togeth\u00ad\ner beyond simple compliance with health \nand safety or other legal and regulatory re\u00ad\nquirements. In our portfolio, we have been \nactive in promoting diversity and inclusion \nand looked to expand the more traditional \ndefinitions of health and safety by review\u00ad\ning mental health processes and practices in \neach of our investee businesses.\nQ\nWho, or what, is driving \ninfrastructure\u2019s increased focus \non sustainable investment and ESG in \nparticular?\nSPONSOR\nHERMES INFRASTRUCTURE\nYou can\u2019t manage what \nyou can\u2019t measure\n\nNovember 2019    \u2022    Sustainable Investing  21\nAnalysis\nOver the past decade, we have witnessed \na step change in the industry\u2019s approach \ntowards ESG. There has been a tectonic \nshift in societal attitudes and increasing ev\u00ad\nidence-based recognition of the impacts of \nclimate change have brought responsibility \nand sustainability very much into the main\u00ad\nstream. With an increasing number of mil\u00ad\nlennials entering the workforce and investor \nuniverse, greater importance is also being \nascribed to making a positive contribution \nto society through the workplace. Political \nand regulatory scrutiny has also reinforced \nthe link between ESG practices and invest\u00ad\nment performance, while legal changes have \nalso had an impact; for instance, the require\u00ad\nment for public pension scheme trustees to \nconsider financially material environmental, \nsocial and governance matters, including cli\u00ad\nmate change, as part of their fiduciary duties. \nWith the increased importance attached to \nESG, LP sophistication has grown and we \nfind that LPs are now driving an agenda that \nwas previously more manager-led. \nQ\nHow does that manifest itself \nin terms of how LPs approach \ndue diligence in this area?

Previously, you \nled a business unit at Hilti. How much resistance do \nyou \u00adexperience from your colleagues, who are now \n\u00adexpected to change many things?\nPeter Rupp: None at all, actually. On the contrary: I have \nthe impression that we currently find that these doors \nare already open. And we are not starting from scratch \neither. There is a great awareness and understanding of \n\u00adsustainability at Hilti. That is why many colleagues I speak \nwith also welcome the fact that we are now addressing \nthese issues in a much more structured way. Because what \nwe have learned at Hilti also applies here: When we focus \non something, we achieve a high impact.\nWhat changes should employees be prepared for?\nPeter Rupp: We don\u2019t want to do everything differently than \nbefore.

Those ambitions come to life across our \nbusiness and are integrated in everything we do, from sustainable \noperations to responsible sourcing and inclusive hiring practices.\n\nOUR JOURNEY TO \nREDUCE EMISSIONS\nAs climate science has evolved, our environmental goals and \napproach have, too. Driven by data, we are leading the industry \nwith ambitious 2030 targets validated by the Science Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi) on our journey toward reducing emissions across our \nentire global portfolio while creating greater operating efficiencies. \nIn partnership with our owners, we reduced single-use plastic \namenities in our hotels, expanded our replacement of traditional \nlight bulbs with more energy-efficient LEDs, offered guests \non-property electric vehicle charging, and provided lower-emission \nchoices with carbon-neutral options for our meetings and events \ncustomers. We also opened what we believe to be the first net-zero \nhotel in the United States: Hotel Marcel New Haven, Tapestry \nCollection by Hilton. \nAdditionally, in 2022 we made a strategic investment in \nFifth Wall\u2019s Climate Tech Fund to support its work to deliver \ninnovative decarbonizing technologies to the real estate industry.\nOUR CULTURE \nOF RESPONSIBILITY  \nHilton is one of the world\u2019s largest hospitality companies, and \nwith more than 7,000 hotels around the globe, we recognize our \nresponsibility to be a leader as an inclusive workplace and to be \na force for good in the communities where we operate. As a \nbusiness of people serving people, we are focused on creating a \nculture that serves our Team Members\u2014from empowering them \nto bring their full selves to work to creating opportunities for all \nin our communities. \nWhen the conflict in Ukraine unfolded, we quickly deployed \nresources to protect our Team Members and guests in the region. \nWe also partnered with American Express to donate room nights \nto support Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian relief efforts \nacross Europe. \nTo further impact our communities, through the Hilton Global \nFoundation, we granted more than $2M to organizations \nthat advance our Travel with Purpose Goals, including awarding \n39 Action Grants for hotels to lead impact projects in their \ncommunities. Finally, throughout the year, our team also expanded \nour relationships with local and diverse suppliers around the world.\nOUR TEAM DEDICATION\nAt the heart of all of these incredible efforts are our more than \n400,000 Team Members, who are working in thousands of \ncommunities globally to share our signature hospitality and make \nthe world a better place.

We have had challenges with constant price increases, \nthe introduction of the UTP directive, increased interest costs, extraordinary shipping costs, disruptions in the value chain and raw \nmaterial shortages, which are critical factors and areas for a product company like Humble. Despite the challenges, we have \nmanaged to maintain strong underlying growth, where we increased pro forma turnover by a whopping 22 percent and at the same \ntime defended our profitability. It is in times that these opportunities arise. I dare say that we are better equipped than ever to \ncontinue on the beaten path of building the leading modern FMCG group.\nDuring the year, we have developed and changed the Group in many ways. We have recently changed accounting principles to IFRS\nand launched the new business segments Future Snacking, Quality Nutrition, Sustainable Care and Nordic Distribution. Overall, the \nnew segments mean a clearer operational focus on the respective core business and show how we position our subsidiaries to jointly \ntake market shares and compete in the traditional trade. At the time of writing, it is absolutely bursting with initiatives and possible \nsynergies between the companies, where my hope is that we will see the results of successful investments and international \nexpansion within a not too long time.\nThe challenging and volatile market in which we find ourselves also shows the strength of belonging to an entrepreneur-driven \ngroup, where the businesses help each other to, for example, obtain raw materials and continue to run profitable campaigns with \ncollective strength. Relatively speaking, we have managed to maintain a good gross profit margin, which testifies to the strength of a \ndynamic business model where our decentralized management offers the necessary flexibility to be able to adapt the business \nweekly to constantly new conditions. This is a marked difference compared to industrial and older FMCG companies, with a \nsignificantly slower pace of change and innovation. Our ability to adapt only makes me more convinced that we are well positioned \nto capitalize on the impending transformation towards health and sustainability, which is still in its infancy but is inevitably\nhappening.\nWe can state that Humble has maintained a lower acquisition rate during 2022 and the beginning of 2023 compared to the previous \nyear. The cost of capital has increased significantly, and it is even more important to obtain maximum returns from the businesses \nthat are already part of the Group. At the same time, we have brought in 13 new operating companies that already contribute both\nwith strategic opportunities and strong underlying cash generation. The new companies open doors for our existing portfolio, \nstrengthen the platform and increase distribution through more international markets and other sales channels.\nThe financial outcome linked to our financial goals has continued to develop well, albeit not at the same pace as in 2021. We have \nfar surpassed the growth goal of at least 15 percent organically. The fulfillment rate of the turnover target increased from 23 percent \nto 43 percent and the profitability target increased from 25 percent to 34 percent. the Group's long-term goal of having a net \ndebt/pro forma adjusted EBITDA of less than 2.5 times is a high priority to reach. We therefore work intensively on optimizing our \ncash generation and the use of working capital to organically strengthen our liquidity and balance sheet.\nIn terms of investment, we have developed the Group at group level to be ready to scale the business and streamline our \noperational platform. We have had an unusually high rate of investment in fixed assets, which has been according to plan to increase \nthe Group's efficiency and the possibility of automation. I also want to highlight the modern BI platform that we built and integrated \nagainst 17 ERP systems in real time. Via the platform, we can in a resource-efficient way and with high accuracy follow the lion's \nshare of the Group in depth and offer better decision-making support to our management teams in their daily business \ndevelopment.\nOur vision of building a leading FMCG player with a focus on health and sustainability stands firm. Of course, it has been a \nch", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

At the same time, challenges \nemerged on new fronts \u2013 in particular, the global \nsemiconductor shortage, which weighed on light-\nvehicle production among its customers, and \ntherefore, demand for the parts it produces. In \nresponse, the Company implemented a variety \nof operational efficiency and flexibility initiatives, \nwhich helped it to mitigate the effects of these \nheadwinds on its business.\nNemak also made further strides towards \nthe implementation of its long-term strategy, \nincluding more than doubling revenue generation \nin its e-mobility and structural applications (EV/\nSC) segment compared to the previous year, \nand surpassing its goal of securing business to \nproduce these parts worth US$1 billion annually \nmore than one year earlier than expected. \nFor full-year 2021, light-vehicle sales and \nproduction in the Company\u2019s markets were \naffected by the ongoing operational disruptions \nin the global semiconductor supply chain.

Through this report, we \ndiscuss how we are conducting our business responsibly while committing to make a difference to the communities and \nthe planet as well as making a positive impact within our markets. \nOur ESG report has been prepared to summarize our business, strategy, and purpose, as well as to provide a comprehensive \nview of the Company\u2019s operations and activities, with a particular emphasis on our environmental, social and governance \n(ESG) initiatives and outcomes. \nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards 2021 with an early adoption of the latest universal \nstandards: Comprehensive option. We have mapped United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) into \nrelevant sections of our report where ICICI Securities play a prominent role in making progress toward specific objectives. \nFinally, this report supplements information published in our Integrated Annual Report 2021-22 and Business Responsibility \nand Sustainability Report (BRSR) FY 2022 where we cover additional information relevant to our ESG performance, \nincluding financial data and corporate governance matters. \nThe reporting scope and boundary for our disclosures, unless otherwise stated, encompasses ICICI Securities operations \nin India. Since we are in the financial sector, our solutions and services rely more significantly on intellectual assets rather \nthan physical assets. There are no changes in the organization or its supply chain from the previous year because our \nsupply chain interactions are largely focused on the acquisition of products and services to support our operations. Our \nESG Report is a component of a comprehensive suite of publications comprising economic, social, and environmental \nfactors that offer transparency and information to our stakeholders.

This has enabled us to \nmaintain our resiliency throughout the COVID-related \noutages. It has never been more important us to be there \nfor all of our stakeholders in a time like this to produce \nshared value. Economic uncertainty caused by the \nsecond wave of pandemic through the first quarter of FY \n2022 made it even clearer that following environmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) policies holistically was \nmore important than simply complying with regulations. \nIt increased our awareness of our responsibility as \na corporate citizen to conduct business sustainably \nand have a positive impact on all our stakeholders, the \nbusiness, and the environment.\nSome of the most important actions we have undertaken \non this front are summarized in our ESG Report. The \nESG Report has been developed to offer more details on \nessential non-financial topics like our policies, practices \nfor undertaking ethical and responsible business and \npractices for addressing material ESG issues, as well as \nour stakeholders, which include our clients, business \npartners, employees, investors, community members, \nand the environment.

The universality \nand global appeal of sport means that the IOC and \nthe Olympic Movement have a special responsibility to \npromote a sustainable future for our world. This is why \nsustainability, together with credibility and youth, is one \nof the three pillars of Olympic Agenda 2020, the strategic \nroadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement. \nThe relevance of sport in society was acknowledged \nin 2015 by the United Nations (UN), when sport was \nhighlighted as an \u201cimportant enabler\u201d to achieve the \nambitious agenda of the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals. This recognition has strengthened our \ndetermination to make sustainability an integral part  \nof all IOC activities. \nSince the adoption of Olympic Agenda 2020, sustainability \nhas been made a priority for all activities of the IOC and \nthe entire Olympic Movement. Chaired by HSH Prince \nAlbert II, the Sustainability and Legacy Commission led \nthe development of the IOC Sustainability Strategy, which \nlays out the principles for the working practices of the \nIOC, the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement  \nwith regards to sustainability. \nThis first IOC Sustainability Report serves as a \nbenchmark to measure our progress on sustainability \nand to chart the challenges that are still ahead. It \noutlines the steps we have taken to make sustainability \nan underpinning principle of all our activities. \nThere is much that has been achieved already. \nFor example, sustainability is now fully embedded \nthroughout the entire lifecycle of the Olympic Games, \nfrom the candidature to the planning and the delivery  \nof the Games, and through to their legacy. Thanks to the \nreforms of Olympic Agenda 2020, we have implemented \na new philosophy for the organisation of Olympic \nGames, with sustainability and feasibility at its heart. \nWith this new approach, our goal is to make the Olympic \nGames a catalyst for sustainable development of cities. \nThe universality and global appeal of sport means \nthat the IOC and the Olympic Movement have  \na special responsibility to promote a sustainable \nfuture for our world.\u201d\n\u201c\n2\u2002\nIOC Sustainability Report\nForewords\n\nThis report also shows how the IOC, together with \nNational Olympic Committees, International Federations, \nas well as athletes, is leading change through a number of \ninitiatives to integrate sustainability principles across the \nOlympic Movement. The IOC as an organisation must also \ndemonstrate its own commitment to sustainability. For this \nreason, sustainability principles are fully integrated into all \ndesign and construction aspects of Olympic House \u2013 the \nIOC\u2019s new headquarters building in Lausanne \u2013 which \nwill open its doors in 2019. In addition, sustainability is \nbeing embedded throughout our day-to-day business \noperations, both in Lausanne and Madrid.\nThomas Bach \nIOC President\nAs the role and relevance of sport in society continues to \ngrow, the IOC is determined to live up to its responsibility \nto build a sustainable future for everyone. In a world that \nis more interdependent than ever before, we know that we \ncan only make progress in cooperation and partnership \nwith others. This is why I call on all stakeholders to \ncontinue our work together to make the world a better \nplace through sport. \n3\u2002\nIOC Sustainability Report\nForewords\n\nEighteen months after publishing the IOC Sustainability \nStrategy, we are proud to present the first IOC \nSustainability Report, which highlights the progress \nacross the IOC\u2019s three spheres of responsibility \u2013 the \nIOC as an organisation, the IOC as owner of the Olympic \nGames and the IOC as leader of the Olympic Movement.\nTo ensure the respect of best practice, we decided to \ncompile the report according to the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI) Standards \u2013 Core Option, and it has  \nbeen independently assured by ERM Certification  \nand Verification Services.\nAlthough we still have more than two years to achieve  \nthe 18 objectives defined for 2020, you will see that  \nmuch progress has already been made.

Automation also has a significant role to play in achieving sustainability goals \u2013 \noffering new ways to accelerate environmental, social, and governance (ESG)  \nactivities across manufacturing, industry, and beyond.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\nIndustry and government stakeholders must embrace automation technologies \nas a leading component of their sustainability goals and strategies:\n\u2022 \nOptimize energy usage and energy efficiency with automation technologies,  \nand rely upon automation to help reuse, refurbish, and recycle products and \nmaterials, particularly when undergoing a facility\u2019s digital transformation \n\u2022\t\nPromote sustainable materials and manufacturing processes in support of  \nIndustry 5.0 principles\n\u2022 \nUtilize automation technologies to keep workers, communities, and ecosystems \nsafe and protected, and train and upskill workers in automation processes  \nand systems\n\u2022\t\nRely upon the objective and unbiased data and analysis provided by automation \ntechnologies to meet governance and compliance needs\nAUTOMATION CAN RAPIDLY ADVANCE SUSTAINABILITY GOALS\nAutomation provides transparency and accountability \u2013 ensuring that policies  \nare safely followed, efficient, and well managed. Further, reliance on automation  \nadvancements will allow industry and government stakeholders to develop even \nmore ambitious goals, strategies, and policies \u2013 taking sustainability initiatives to \nthe next level, just as manufacturing advancements have been achieved through \nthe application of these same technologies. Finally, a well-prepared workforce \nequipped with knowledge about the power of automation and digital transformation \ntechnologies will allow for these critical technologies to be applied in innovative \nways \u2013 creating economic opportunities and fulfilling environmental goals. \nThe International Society of Automation (ISA), the leading professional society  \nfor automation, offers standards, training, credentials, conformity assessment \nprograms, and other important resources that support efforts to use automation \nas a tool to achieve sustainability goals \u2013 for individuals, organizations, companies, \nand governments alike. \nPOSITION PAPER\nAchieving Sustainability \nGoals with Automation\nBalancing Economic Opportunity and  \nEnvironmental Responsibility\nInternational Society of Automation\nSetting the Standard for Automation\u2122\n\nINDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT STANCES ON SUSTAINABILITY\nOver the past decades, many corporations have pledged their commitment to  \nsustainability and environmental practices, with some making further commitments  \ntoward science-based targets, carbon neutrality, and net-zero targets. Shareholders \nand boards are demanding sustainability and social responsibility  \nas key corporate values in addition to profitability, and Industry \n5.01  looms large as the next strategic direction for industry  \nand government. \nRecently, United States regulators have shown strong support  \nfor sustainable manufacturing practices in the Inflation Reduction \nAct2, and the European Union\u2019s Green Deal Industrial Plan for the \nNet-Zero Age3 pledges to scale up capabilities to achieve net-zero \nenergy consumption and net-zero carbon emissions. \nA recent industry survey by PwC confirms that 60% of the world\u2019s  \nlargest companies have committed to a net-zero greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions target.4 Even with the uncertainty of the current \neconomic climate, sustainability promises will not be abandoned \nacross the industry, and per J.P.Morgan5 may matter even more \nin 2023 and beyond.\nTHE ROLE OF AUTOMATION IN ESG\nEnvironmental Pillar: Reduce \u2013 Recycle \u2013 Reuse \nReduce\t Automation leads to more efficient processes that make more efficient  \nuse of materials \u2013 reducing the amount of materials and energy needed to  \nproduce products. Further, as automation technology continues to improve, \nso too does quality, resulting in less material wasted on poor products \nand less energy, human effort, and money wasted on rework. As costs fall, \nmanufacturers have access to more capital through higher margins or the \nability to be more competitive with pricing. \nRecycle\t More precise measurements and better automation have helped companies \nbetter understand the cost savings and the tools to implement recycling \nprograms. A prominent example is the work being done to reduce water \nusage in the semiconductor industry using recycling, thanks to new water \ntreatment processes. When less water is used and disposed of, companies \ncan enjoy much lower utility costs, which can have a large impact on the  \nbottom line. \nReuse\t\nThe concepts of refurbish and repair are central to the automation industry, \nwhich has always sought to interface larger, older systems with state-of-\nthe-art centralized control systems.

The theme \u201cShaping \nthe Future\u201d encapsulates the pathways that \nwe have defined to pursue our vision of \n\u201cResponsible Competitiveness\u201d and contribute \nto a world that\u2019s greener and cleaner while \nsupporting livelihoods at scale. It is immensely \nheartening that ITC is today recognised as \na global exemplar in sustainability, having \nachieved many a milestone over the years \nwith multi-dimensional interventions that \nhave been innovative, inclusive and impactful. \nIt is a matter of pride that our innovative \nbusiness models have enabled ITC to achieve \nthe global environmental distinction of being \ncarbon, water and solid waste re-cycling \npositive enterprise for over 18, 21 and 16 \nyears respectively and support sustainable \nlivelihoods of over 6 million people.  It is \nimmensely satisfying that the first 12 LEED \nZero Carbon hotels in the world and the first \n2 LEED Zero Water properties are ITC Hotels. \nITC\u2019s Foods unit at Malur became Asia\u2019s first \nfood processing facility to be awarded the \nAWS Platinum level certification, the highest \nrecognition for water stewardship in the world, \nwhich follows a similar achievement for our \nPaperboards Unit in Kovai, the first site in India \nand the first paper mill in the world to achieve \nthis certification. ITC Sankhya in Bengaluru \nbecame the first data centre in the world to be \nawarded the LEED Zero Carbon certification. \nITC has also implemented large-scale \ninterventions for empowerment of farmers and \nrural communities. Today, many corporates \nare mainstreaming sustainability - some even \nembracing it as their core brand identity. \nHowever, it is evident that our collective efforts \nneed to be scaled up further to address the \nrisks posed by the mounting \nsustainability threats.\nA World in Permacrisis \nWe live today in a world of permacrisis \nand uncertainty.

Furthermore, the three main pillars of sustainable development were\ndefined as economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality, where\nno one element is more important than the other. If one element dominates the others,\nor one element is neglected, the system becomes instable and collapses.\nThirty years later, the language has become more sophisticated, and at the\nSustainable Development Summit in 2015 we witnessed the introduction of the\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a collection of 17 interlinked global\ngoals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future\nfor all. This was a major step for a broader communication, and even down to\nkindergartens, the message was heard.Message from IWC\u2019s CEOSustainable development:A language and a culture\n\nPage 3\nAt IWC, we have recently participated in the implementation of the Taxonomy Regulation that was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June\n22, 2020, and entered into force on July 12, 2020. It establishes the basis for the EU taxonomy by setting out overarching conditions that an economic activity\nmust meet in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable. The Taxonomy Regulation establishes six environmental objectives:\n1.\nClimate change mitigation\n2.\nClimate change adaptation\n3.\nSustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n4.\nTransition to a circular economy\n5.\nPollution prevention and control\n6.\nProtection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\nWe report the storage of carbon in our clients\u2019 standing forests, as well as the use of the wood taken out of the forests. The more wood is stored in buildings, the\nbetter for the climate. We also report on farmland investments which are key to a sustainable transition.\nFor both asset classes, in our due diligence of new assets, we look into climate change, social impacts, and biodiversity. Tools are being developed and\nbaselines are established.\nWe are not there yet, and will never be, as ESG is an ever-evolving field, but we pride ourselves to be at the forefront of the developments regarding ESG\ncomponents relevant to our business and our clients. This is our belief and culture at IWC.\nOtto Reventlow\nOtto Reventlow\nCEO of the IWC Group\n\nMessage from IWC\u2019s CEO\nSustainability at our core\nESG framework five-year review\nLooking ahead\n2021 ESG highlights\n\uf0a7\nCarbon and timber accounting\n\uf0a7\nSustainable forests and biodiversity conservation\n\uf0a7\nWatersheds protection and restoration\n\uf0a7\nESG integration\n\uf0a7\nPhysical impacts.\nPage 4\n\nThe IWC Group (IWC) is a leading natural resources investment expert with global expertise and experience in natural capital investments \u2013 timberland,\nagriculture, and ecosystems restoration \u2013 providing diversification, inflation hedge, capital appreciation, and ESG-proof investment opportunities to institutional\ninvestors.

ESG issues can be interpreted as the most important management areas, i.e. the issues that could\ncause the most significant business and/or environmental/social impacts if not managed well. The location on the matrix indicates the relative\nimportance of the ESG issue, with those located in the top right corners being the most material for the industry as a whole. The graph also\nhighlights the 2-3 ESG issues that, for the company under consideration, our analysts have identified as the most relevant to comment on in\nmore detail. This selection takes into account company specific factors such as business model, geographic presence, product offering, as well\nas important recent developments and trends (e.g. incidents, announcements of new initiatives, management changes).

This stems from its leading position on environmental, social and governance\nissues. The company has been implicated in no significant ESG-related controversies.\nBased in Switzerland, Implenia AG primarily engages in construction activities. The company is organized in four divisions: Buildings (around 47% of FY2020\nexternal revenue), Civil Engineering (46%), Specialties (5%) and Real Estate (2%). In FY2020, 79% of Implenia\u2019s  external revenue was derived from Switzerland\nand Germany. Sweden, Norway and France, among other countries, accounted for the remainder.\n Implenia develops and constructs large-scale infrastructure projects that require bidding for public contracts. Potential involvement in unethical business acts such\nas kickbacks may lead to investigations, fines and indictment of company executives. Moreover, Implenia\u2019s success relies on a vast (8,701 FTEs as of year-end\n2020) and diversely skilled workforce, with employees ranging from architects and engineers, to construction workers. Failure to attract and retain qualified\npersonnel could lead to skill shortages, delays in fulfilling contractual agreements and customer losses. In addition, Implenia operates in Europe, where customers\ndemonstrate increasing concern for the carbon footprint of the projects they commission. An inability to include sustainable materials and green buildings in its\noffering may result in loss of business opportunities and reduction of market share. Based on its operations, we consider Bribery and Corruption, Human Capital and\nE&S Impact of Products and Services to be the company's notable ESG issues.\nImplenia publishes a Sustainability Report written in accordance with the GRI Standards, Core option, every other year, demonstrating adequate accountability to\ninvestors and the public with respect to ESG issues. The company's board is responsible for its sustainability strategy, suggesting that ESG matters are integrated\nin core business strategy.\n The company's overall management of ESG issues is strong.\nBr", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

However, biomass \nurgently deserves greater attention because the climate impacts can be more significant \nthan for coal and financing of new biomass infrastructure would lock in future carbon \nemissions, which must be avoided. \nThis paper focuses entirely on the climate impacts of biomass power, the combustion of solid \nbiomass derived from wood to generate electricity. However, there are additional impacts on \nforest biodiversity, public health and community rights, which also need to be considered by \ninvestors. Preserving natural forests, and re-establishing biodiverse forest ecosystems, has a \nwide range of important benefits in addition to building climate resilience.\nThe key messages of this paper are summarised in the following pages. \n\u201c \nBiomass urgently deserves greater attention because the \nclimate impacts can be more significant than for coal and \nfinancing of new biomass infrastructure would lock in future \ncarbon emissions, which must be avoided.  \n\u201d\n \n\n2\nFlawed assumption \nThere is a flawed assumption that biomass \nis a carbon neutral fuel and a solution to \nclimate change. Therefore carbon emissions \nfrom burning wood have been ignored by \nutility companies and policy makers for two \nreasons.  Firstly, because it is incorrectly \nseen as a \u201crenewable\u201d resource.

It was our way \nof summarizing the standards and practices we\u2019ve been \ndedicated to for more than 45 years. We\u2019re pleased to \nprovide updates on how we\u2019ve matured toward fulfilling \nour commitments through this report.\nOur approach enables our associates, clients, and \ncommunities to succeed \u2013 not just for today, but for \ntomorrow. We recognize that corporate responsibility is \na journey and that we\u2019ll never really \u201carrive.\u201d However, \nwe are committed to progressing and being transparent \nwith the progress we make. We exist in a world that \nis ever-evolving, and we adapt. Despite the changing \ntimes, one thing that remains constant is Jack Henry\u2019s \ncommitment to championing corporate responsibility \nand ensuring that the actions we take today benefit \nthe world tomorrow. I am confident that together, we \ncan face any challenge before us.

L\u2019Unione Europea, per esempio, ha \ndeciso di stanziare un fondo per la ripresa \neconomica: il \u201cNext Generation EU\u201d, in cui ogni \nStato membro beneficiario del Fondo dovr\u00e0 \nsuddividere la somma destinando il 37% alla \n \n1 https://www.pltpuregreen.it/sostenibilita/  \ntransizione \nambientale, \nil \n20% \nalla \ndigitalizzazione e all\u2019innovazione e il 43% alla \nsostenibilit\u00e0 sociale.  \n \nSpinte anche dalle scelte governative, le \norganizzazioni moderne ormai non possono pi\u00f9 \nfocalizzarsi unicamente su risultati economici, \nma devono anche iniziare ad occuparsi di temi \nextra-finanziari, cos\u00ec sia le multinazionali sia le \nPMI hanno iniziato a monitorare il loro \nprogresso per raggiungere gli obiettivi SDGs \nattraverso il ranking ESG. \nIl ranking ESG, o anche ranking di sostenibilit\u00e0, \nvaluta la solidit\u00e0 di un ente tenendo conto delle \nperformance in termini ambientali, sociali e di \ngovernance, con l\u2019obiettivo di mettere a \ndisposizione pi\u00f9 informazioni su cui basare \nscelte di acquisto e di investimento. Il rating \nESG \nanalizza \ni \nrendimenti \nsocietari \nprendendo in considerazione dati provenienti \nda diverse tipologie di documenti, sia interni che \nesterni alla struttura. \n \n \nhttp://sapdigitaltalks.it/?p=1858  \nPer comprendere al meglio l\u2019inserimento del \ntema sostenibilit\u00e0 a livello aziendale, occorre \nosservare il modello del triangolo equilatero, \nformulato nel 1993 dai due esperti di finanza \ngiapponesi Giaoutzi e Nijkamp. \n\nLa ESG \u00e8 un vantaggio competitive nella Food Industry \nMaster in Food Industry Management 2021-2022 \n \n \n3 \nI \ntre \nvertici \ndel \ntriangolo \nindicano \nla \nfocalizzazione su un solo obiettivo, i lati sono \ninterpretabili come la relazione tra due obiettivi, \nmentre l\u2019interno viene inteso come relazione tra \nle \ndimensioni: \nambientale, \nsociale \ned \neconomica.

In addition, KPN offers third party telecom providers access to our nationwide fixed and mobile \nnetworks.\n \n1.2\t\nOur Customers\nAs the market leader in the Netherlands, we are committed to millions of households and businesses. From \nmobile data users to households that purchase all-in-1 packages and business customers with ICT services and \nworkspaces. More and more customers are combining fixed and mobile services. Customer satisfaction is essential \nfor KPN. An important indicator for this is NPS (Net Promotor Score). The higher the NPS score, the more strongly \na customer would recommend KPN to others. \n1\t Introduction\n5.630 million\nMobile subscribers1\n1.485 million\nFixed-mobile households \n3.136 million\nBroadband lines1\n+15 \nNPS Consumer\n3.096 million\nFttH homes passed\n(own roll-out)\n+3\nNPS Business\nNote: data as per Q3 2021 \n1 Consumer and Business segments, excludes Wholesale\n Content\n\nSustainability-Linked Finance Framework\u2003 4 \n1.3\t\nOur Strategy\nThe core of our strategy is that we are speeding things up in line with the digitalization of society. Every day,  \nwe are working on the network of the future \u2013 a network of people and technology that facilitates progress.  \nWe are doing everything within our power to connect everyone in the Netherlands to a sustainable future.  \nWith our strategy \u2018Accelerate to grow\u2019 we are focussing on three pillars: \nWith this strategy KPN will grow mass-market service revenues and EBITDA and enable KPN to continue its \nprogressive dividend policy, covered by growing Free Cash Flow. It will also lead the Dutch digitalization wave to \nconnect the Netherlands to a sustainable future. \n1. Leverage & expand superior network\nKPN has built a state-of-the art network architecture with the vast majority of mobile sites built for high capacity \nand connected to fiber. KPN has already connected over one-third of households in the Netherlands directly to \nfiber. In the coming years KPN will leverage and expand this superior network by accelerating its fiber rollout to \napproximately half a million homes passed per year with the intention to cover 80% of Dutch households by 2026 \n(together with Glaspoort, KPN\u2019s joint venture with APG).\n2. Grow & strengthen customer footprint\nKPN is focused on growing mass-market services revenues through a strengthened and growing customer \nfootprint in the Consumer, SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) and Wholesale segments, which represent \napproximately 75% of KPN\u2019s revenues and 90% of its adjusted EBITDA AL. KPN will be the preferred digital partner \nfor households through (i) the best digital access with fiber, 5G, and in-home WIFI; (ii) the best digital  \nomni-channel experience with a mobile-first and app-centric customer approach; and (iii) the best third-party \nservices through entertainment partnerships. In Business, KPN has a clear segmented customer focus for SME,  \nLCE (large commercial enterprises) and Tailored Solutions. In Wholesale, KPN continues its open access policy to \noffer access to third-party operators with fiber contributing to continued growth of Wholesale revenues. \n3. Simplify & streamline operating model\nKPN will further simplify and streamline its operating model to prepare for the next wave of digitalization, which \nwill truly change customer experience, enhances KPN\u2019s time-to-market and contributes to a next wave of cost \nefficiencies. Along with portfolio simplification, digital customer journeys, and IT and network rationalization,  \nKPN is executing on COVID-accelerated cost opportunities e.g., moving to more remote working and \nan adjusted office footprint.\nThree strategic pillars\u2026\n...to support our ambition to\nAccelerate to Grow strategy supported by three key pillars\n1.

This has required \ndecisions of the Board in relation to the capital \nstructure of the Company and the business plan. \nUS$190m additional debt was raised in April 2019 \nto maintain liquidity but trading performance \nweakened further resulting in the Trading  \nUpdate\u00a0and Revised Outlook announced on \n24\u00a0July\u00a02019. \nTrading through Q3 continued to be weak, \nputting further pressure on liquidity and so the \nBoard authorised the drawing of further debt.  \nThis resulted in the raising of US$150m of Senior \nSecured Notes announced in September 2019, \nwith a potential to raise an additional US$100m  \nof Delayed Draw Notes. As a result, the Board \ncalled for a fundamental operational, financial \nand strategic review of the business.\nWith debt at heightened levels and cost of new debt \nonerous, the Board agreed a sizeable capital raise \nwas necessary in order to continue operations. \nTrading continued to underperform through the \npeak December delivery period resulting in a further \nTrading Update on 7 January 2020. Despite the \nfinancial condition of the Company, the brand and \nthe excellence of its cars attracted significant interest \nfrom high quality strategic and financial investors.\nA thorough process was conducted which \nresulted in the unanimous decision of the Board \nto announce on 31 January 2020 a proposed \nstrategic investment of \u00a3182m by a consortium \nled by Lawrence Stroll and an underwritten Rights \nIssue supported by major shareholders, Prestige/\nSEIG and Adeem/PW, of \u00a3318m to raise \ncombined gross proceeds of \u00a3500m. \nA reset business plan was also announced with  \na focus on (i) adjusting production to prioritise  \ndemand over supply, thereby building a stronger \norder book and regaining price positioning,  \n(ii) delaying investment in electric vehicles to no \nearlier than 2025 and to move out mid-engined \nmodel roll out to 2022 with the Valhalla to be \nrevealed then, (iii) focusing on the successful launch \nCHAIR\u2019S STATEMENT \nPENNY HUGHES, CBE\nTHIS HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTING \nYEAR\u00a0FOR ASTON MARTIN LAGONDA. \nREVENUES OF \u00a3997M, (9% LOWER)  \nAND A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN ADJUSTED \nEBITDA TO \u00a3134M (DOWN 46%),  \nHAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SEVERE \nPRESSURE ON LIQUIDITY WHICH  \nHAS LEFT THE COMPANY WITH NO \nALTERNATIVE BUT TO SEEK \u00a3500M  \nOF ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING, \nWITHOUT WHICH, THE BALANCE \nSHEET IS NOT ROBUST ENOUGH  \nTO SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS OF  \nTHE GROUP. \nASTON MARTIN LAGONDA GLOBAL HOLDINGS PLC 2019 ANNUAL REPORT\n4\n\nCHAIR\u2019S STATEMENT\nof DBX, the relaunch of Vantage and commencing \ndeliveries of Valkyrie in 2020 and (iv) reducing \noperating costs and capital expenditure and giving \npriority to improving the Company\u2019", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

For over \n175 years, Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli has proudly lived up to this promise, \nbuilding a global reputation for excellence, innovation, and sustain-\nability. As we look forward, our purpose guides us to make a positive \nimpact and help create a better future.\nThe world faces many challenges, such as the deterioration of \nnature and biodiversity, which are the basis of life and our products. \nClimate change has the potential to exacerbate social conflicts and \nchallenge agricultural production of raw materials. Human rights \nviolations are still widespread, reinforcing inequalities and hindering \nthe improvement of livelihoods for many people.\nThe Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli Sustainability Plan is our ambition to help \naddress these challenges and to create a better tomorrow. It is our \npathway to becoming more sustainable along our entire value chain, \nfrom sourcing and production to packaging and consumption.\nWe continue to build on this solid foundation: in 2021, more than \n91,000 farmers participated in our Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli Farming Program \nand 100% of our cocoa beans and 64% of our cocoa beans equivalent \nare sourced through sustainability programs. Our first complete \ncarbon footprint has revealed that our greatest leverage to limit climate \nchange is in our value chain, namely in sourcing cocoa and other \nraw materials, as well as in transportation and packaging initiatives. \nThis footprint will enable us to announce our Science Based GHG \nReduction Targets in 2023. We also rolled out our Sustainable Pack-\naging initiative further, which aims to make 100% of packaging \nrecyclable by 2025 and to reduce the use of plastics.\nThis progress demonstrates that Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli\u2019s Purpose, Mission, \nand Values are anchored deep within our culture and in the hearts \nof our employees, motivating everyone along our value chain to \ncontribute to a more sustainable future.\nGoing forward, we anticipate a rapid increase and strengthening \nof social, environmental, and corporate governance regulations, \ngrowth in investor interest, and the allocation of more resources \ntoward sustainable solutions. There will also be increasing demand \nfrom our business, trade, and supply chain partners \u2013 as well as \ngrowing awareness and expectations from our employees, consumers, \nand the general public \u2013 for improved sustainability performance.\nThis encourages us to further strengthen Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli\u2019s good \nbusiness conduct. We consider business integrity and human rights \nas cross-cutting issues relevant throughout the Lindt\u2009&\u2009Sprungli \nSustainability Plan and our way of doing business. We are currently \ndeveloping a human rights policy and action plan, which will for-\nmalize our commitment even further.\nWe are proud to share our 12th annual Sustainability Report, for \nthe first time referencing the reporting standards of the Global \nReporting Initiative (GRI).\n\t \t \t\nDr Dieter Weisskopf\t\nMartin Hug\nCEO Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli Group\t\nCFO Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli Group\nDr Dieter Weisskopf, CEO Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli Group\nMartin Hug, CFO Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli Group \nand Head of the Sustainability Executive Team\n   3   \nSUSTAINABILITY R EPORT 2021\nLINDT\u200a&\u200aSPR\u00dc NGLI \nMA\u00ceTRE CHOCOLATIER SUISSE DEPUIS 1845\nKPIs and Appendix \nDelighting consumers\nPerforming together\nContributing to an intact environment\nImproving livelihoods\nIntroduction and Strategy\n\nAbout Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli\nOur Group includes 8 brands: \nLindt, Ghirardelli, \nRussell Stover, Whitman's, \nPangburn's, C", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

We stepped up our efforts in three prio-\nrity areas, which respond to today\u2019s major social and \nenvironmental issues: protecting and restoring natu-\nral and cultivated biodiversity; delivering dramatic \nchanges to mitigate the climate crisis; and finally, \ncreating opportunities and empowering all people in \nthe communities in which we are engaged, with a \nfocus on women\u2019s empowerment. We want to conti-\nnue to consolidate the Group\u2019s and its brands\u2019 actions \nin these areas, which lie at the core of our responsi-\nbility as an international manufacturer and retailer of \nbeauty and well-being products.\nI am very proud to announce our first objective in this \nrespect: contribute to the world\u2019s carbon neutrality by \nachieving Net Zero emissions across the Group by \n2030 and on our two French production sites by 2025. \nInspired by the Science-Based Targets initiative, our \nfirst effort remains to avoid and reduce the Group\u2019s \nown emissions, and to achieve greater sobriety throu-\nghout our value chain. By 2020, we are well on track \nto achieving a 30% reduction of our carbon intensity \nfrom the levels of emissions recorded in 2010. While \nthese efforts to avoid and reduce our footprint across \nthe supply chain will continue to be our priority, this \nyear L\u2019OCCITANE Group will also initiate several car-\nbon sequestration projects. We will prioritise nature-\nbased solutions such as reforestation projects that will \nhave to offer the joint benefits of protecting biodiver-\nsity, sequestering carbon and improving livelihoods.\nSYLVAIN DESJONQU\u00c8RES\nL\u2019OCCITANE Group Managing Director\nREINOLD GEIGER\nL\u2019OCCITANE Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThe L\u2019OCCITANE Group has been following a coherent \npath for years, with the unfailing ambition to preserve \nand regenerate biodiversity while also strengthe-\nning relations of trust and fair trade with all our \u201cpar-\ntner-producers\u201d of natural raw materials.

Together with our RBC Strategy colleague Sara\nMahaffy, we explore recent ESG investment trends, and provide detail of our coverage\nuniverse's sustainability efforts and goals across key restaurant-specific ESG categories, as\nidentified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\nThe growing importance of sustainable investing: By our estimate, we\u2019ve identified $476 billion in\ndedicated sustainable equity funds (with meaningful assets invested in the US), up from just $182 billion\nat the end of 2018. Net inflows into these funds have accelerated in recent years, with 4Q inflows on\npace to hit another new record. In terms of how these funds are positioned in S&P 500 Restaurants,\nSBUX is the only name that ranks relatively high in the actively managed funds within our universe. The\nother names (MCD, YUM, DRI, CMG, DPZ) either rank in the middle tiers or lower tiers of ownership.\nFurther improvements in their ESG profiles could allow them to tap into more funds.\nWe believe labor practices will be an area of increasing focus for ESG investors in a post-COVID\nworld: While energy usage, waste reduction and supply chain practices remain obvious ESG focus\nareas for restaurants, we see human capital management\u2014encompassing labor practices and employee\nengagement, diversity and inclusion\u2014as an increasingly important topic moving forward, particularly as\nthe industry continues to navigate the pandemic. Our belief is that human capital management not only\nimpacts brand perception, but is also of paramount importance to restaurants' fundamental business\nperformance. The brands in our coverage are responsible for approximately 18 billion transactions\nannually in the US alone (representing nearly a quarter of domestic restaurant sales), with the\nvast majority still involving face-to-face interaction between company or franchisee employees and\ncustomers, despite the rise of digital ordering. As such, service quality and operational efficiency\u2014which\nwe view as closely linked to labor practices and employee engagement\u2014can be a top-line driver for\nrestaurants, rather than another expense line item. Although external pressures (e.g. government-\nmandated wage increases) likely continue to place upward pressure on labor expense longer term,\nwe encourage investors to consider the offsetting benefits of continued investment in restaurants'\nworkforces.\nScale matters as the restaurant industry consolidates and large brands gain share\u2014but scale\nalso highlights the importance of sustainability efforts: A core tenet of our restaurant investment\nframework is that scale matters, particularly as COVID-19 has only accelerated share consolidation by\nthe largest brands. Scale benefits restaurants in areas such as product innovation and marketing, but\nalso in resources dedicated to sustainability, and we would highlight Outperform-rated MCD and SBUX\nas companies within our coverage with significant scale, and among those with the most sophisticated\nand detailed sustainability goals and disclosure. In spite of the larger spotlight drawn upon the biggest\nbrands, we believe our restaurants coverage has largely embraced the challenge and complexity of\ncrafting and executing upon sustainability strategies.\nESG factors have outperformed within the S&P 500 in recent years: We\u2019ve noticed the following key\nESG trends in recent years: (1) top S&P 500 holdings in dedicated, actively managed sustainable funds\nhave outperformed, including those stocks that are uniquely popular to sustainable funds; (2) S&P 500\ncompanies with better ESG risk profiles have outperformed those with worse ESG risk profiles; (3) S&P\n500 companies with the most improvement in ESG risk scores have outperformed those with the least\nimprovement on a sector neutral basis.

Precisely 2015 represented a turning \npoint boosting momentum on sustainability \nissues and on the concept that sustainable \ndevelopment concerns everyone and is the \nmost important contemporary challenge that \nno one can afford to miss out on. Indeed, \n2015 was the year of the Paris Agreement on \nClimate, of the Encyclical Laudato Si\u2019 and the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \npromoted by the UN.\nIn December 2019, the increasing impact of the \nclimate crisis led the President of the European \nCommission, Ursula von der Leyen, to present \nthe European Green Deal that aims to make \nEurope the first continent with zero climate \nimpact by 2050. \u201cThe pandemic, and the \nsubsequent economic crisis, prompted the EU \nto formulate a coordinated response both at \nthe cyclical level, with huge economic support \npackages adopted by individual Member \nStates, and structurally, in particular with the \nlaunch of the Next Generation EU programme \n(NGEU) in July 2020. The Next Generation EU \nmarks a sea change for the EU.\u201d1\nFor Italy, the NGEU represents an unmissable \nopportunity for development, investment and \nreform.\nIndeed, in this context, the National Recovery \nand Resilience Plan (PNRR) represents an \nextraordinary opportunity for economic \nrecovery and sustainable development for \nour country, structured around 3 strategic \naxes shared at European level: digitalization \nand innovation, ecological transition and \nsocial inclusion. The PNRR is structured \naround 6 Missions: digitalization, innovation, \ncompetitiveness and culture; green revolution \nand ecological transition; infrastructure for \nsustainable mobility; education and research; \ninclusion and cohesion; health.\nThe PNRR embraces the system ratio \npromoted by the 2030 Agenda, which \nconsiders sustainability in its 3 dimensions \n(social, economic and environmental), and \nidentifies 17 Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs) showing how each is closely connected \nto all others.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were \ndramatic and, after an initial improvement \nin some indicators, resulted in a sharp \nslowdown in progress towards the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, with significant \nrepercussions at all levels.

Only through our collective efforts can we \nhope to ensure and preserve the universal human rights to which everyone is entitled.\nKurt Sievers \nPresident and CEO, NXP Semiconductors \nJune 2023\nOther notable achievements of 2022, also described in more detail in this Report, include:\nA MESSAGE FROM KURT SIEVERS, PRESIDENT AND CEO\n99%  \nof our suppliers signed the \nNXP Supplier Code of Conduct \nConformity Statement\n2022 ACHIEVEMENTS\nWe doubled  \nthe number of supply-chain \ndue-diligence audits compared \nto 2021\nWe achieved an 88%  \nclosure rate for supplier \ncorrective action plans and \ncontinued to work on the closure \nof nonconformances from \nprevious years\n3 \n2022 HIGHLIGHTS\nINTRODUCTION\nLABOR AND HUMAN-\nRIGHTS COMMITMENT\nHUMAN-RIGHTS  \nDUE DILIGENCE\nLOOKING FORWARD\nCONCLUSION\nACRONYMS AND \nABBREVIATIONS\n\n4 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n2022 HIGHLIGHTS..........................................................................5 \nINTRODUCTION.............................................................................8\n   \t\nOur Business...........................................................................10  \n\t\nOur Operations.......................................................................12 \n\t\nOur Team Members................................................................13 \n\t\nOur Supply Chain...................................................................18 \n\t\nOur Goals...............................................................................19\nLABOR AND HUMAN-RIGHTS COMMITMENT.........................20 \nHUMAN-RIGHTS DUE DILIGENCE..............................................24\n\t\nIdentify and Assess.................................................................31 \n\t\nIntegrate and Act....................................................................39 \n\t\nTrack........................................................................................57 \n\t\nCommunicate.........................................................................65\nLOOKING FORWARD..................................................................70\nCONCLUSION...............................................................................73 \nACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS...........................................75 \n4 \nENGAGE \u2022 PROTECT \u2022 RESPECT\n4 \n2022 HIGHLIGH", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

We hit a new milestone \nsince beginning our circularity \njourney and have collected over \n1.6 million garments to be resold \nor recycled through our trade-in \nprogram, operated in partnership with \nthredUP. \nSecondly, we\u2019re proud to have \nexpanded our Fair Trade reach, \ncertifying three additional factories \nand contributing nearly $1 million in \npremiums that directly benefit the \npeople who craft our products. \nAdditionally, you will find that we \ncontinue to step up our efforts \naround critical issues like the climate \ncrisis, biodiversity loss, and social \ninequality. This year, we launched our \nfirst program focused on protecting \nbiodiversity and made progress in \nadvancing regenerative agriculture \npractices. We believe these issues \nare critical to the long-term health \nof both our planet and our company \nand are taking steps to ensure we are \ndoing our part in an equitable way.  \nNone of this would be possible \nwithout the people behind Madewell. \nOur associates are core to our success, \nand we remain committed to creating \na positive and empowering place \nfor them to work. Our commitment \nto Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and \nBelonging (DEIB) is stronger than ever \nas we initiated company-wide DEIB \ntraining, launched branded pronoun \npins supporting LGBTQ+ inclusion, \nand partnered with Open to All\u2019s \nRetail Charter to reduce racial bias in \nretail. I couldn\u2019t be more proud that \nin 2022, J.Crew Group was named \none of Forbes\u2019 Best Employers for \nDiversity and earned a 100% score on \nthe Human Right Campaign Corporate \nEquality Index. \nThank you for believing in us to do \nwell.

We believe the touchstones of responsible leadership \nare integrity and fairness. In 2020, we continued to strengthen our board of directors with new members who value \nthe interests of all our stakeholders\u2014clients, employees, investors and business partners. We benefit greatly from \nhaving board members who bring proven leadership to our ESG efforts.\n\u2022\t\nHelping communities become more resilient. We expanded our support in 2020 to organizations that are on the \nfrontline of addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the immediate challenge of food insecurity. \nTo address community resilience over the long term, we established the MarketAxess Charitable Foundation, whose \nmission is to work with organizations that support underserved communities, with an emphasis on youth education, \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\u2022\t\nBuilding a strong, diverse workforce. We believe a strong culture built on accountability and mutual respect has \nbeen a significant factor in our success, and will continue to be even more so in the future. This year\u2019s report details \nthe initiatives we\u2019ve taken to sustain our culture and ensure its continued vitality as we grow. Diversity, equity, and \ninclusion must remain a priority if we are to continue to be prosperous over the long term, and our management \nteam is working hard to strengthen this important part of our ESG program.\n\u2022\t\nAdopting sound sustainability practices across our business operations. We are in the process of improving \nour ability to measure our company\u2019s impact in areas such as climate, waste, and water use. As an initial part of that \neffort, we are reporting for 2020 against metrics outlined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for \nthe first time for the following sectors: Security & Commodity Exchanges, Professional & Commercial Services, and \nSoftware & IT Services.\nOn the environment, it\u2019s worth noting that MarketAxess already plays an important role in \naddressing the growing investor interest in bonds financing climate-friendly projects. With an \nestimated 20.3% US market share of trading in corporate and municipal green bonds in 2020, \nMarketAxess ranks as the largest corporate and municipal green bond marketplace, with 2020 \ntrading volume up 42% in this category alone. We believe our role in the secondary market for these \nissues is poised to grow, given forecasts that global green bond issuance will reach $400-$500 billion \nthis year, up from about $270 billion in 2019.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2021, I want to  \nthank all our employees for their continued, active \nengagement in our ESG journey. In doing so, they are \nbuilding a stronger, more dynamic company for everyone  \nat MarketAxess, for our clients, and for our shareholders\u2014 \none that can be a positive force in global markets as well  \nas in our communities.\n\u2014Rick McVey\nMessage from Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess\nFew periods in recent history have tested the values of our society and its institutions more \ndirectly than 2020, a year marked by the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s disruptions to our daily \nlives, impassioned calls for social justice, and contentious political events. In this challenging \nenvironment, I am proud to say, the MarketAxess community held fast to its core values.  \nWe can look back on 2020 as a year in which we deepened our commitment to our company\u2019s \npurpose, to the importance of respecting one another, and to addressing the needs of  \nour communities. \nIt\u2019s clear we made significant advances in realizing our purpose: To open global markets and \ncreate more op", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

As travel demand continued to recover in \n2022, there were still several major global issues creating \nchallenging conditions worldwide. Marriott associates \naround the world have been working hard not only to \nweather the crises and rebound, but also to continue \nhelping others and serving the communities in which \nthey live and work. Our associates\u2019 resilience is truly \noutstanding. As associates, guests, hotel owners, and \nfranchisees are increasingly seeking companies that reflect \ntheir values, we remain committed to Serving Our World.\nFostering an Inclusive Culture\nMarriott\u2019s commitment to associates truly sets our \ncompany apart. In 2022, I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve \nmade in attracting, growing, and retaining talent while \nworking to foster an inclusive culture where everyone feels \nthat they belong. We have been investing in associates \nglobally \u2014 through even more-competitive compensation, \nbenefits, and rewards \u2014 and we also expanded eligibility \nin the company\u2019s bonus plans for select associates. We \nwelcomed many new associates to Marriott last year, \nand we remained focused on growing great leaders at \nall levels and providing the right support. Core to who we \nare as a company is the sense of belonging. To that end, \nwe expanded the company\u2019s Associate Networks and \nlaunched executive-sponsored Associate Resource Groups \n(ARGs) to engage associates, enhance our culture, and \nsupport recruitment, retention, and diversity, equity, and \ninclusion efforts. Among these efforts is our goal to achieve \nglobal gender parity at the vice president level and above \nby the end of 2023.\nGrowing great leaders, investing in associates, and \nproviding access to opportunity supports a strong \nfoundation and we are proud of Marriott\u2019s associates, \nwho have been the drivers of the company\u2019s progress in \nenvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts.\nHuman Trafficking Awareness Training\nWe have taken a leading role in the fight against one \nof the industry\u2019s most pressing human rights issues \u2014 \nhuman trafficking \u2014 and in December 2022, we reached a \nmilestone of having trained one million Marriott associates \nin human trafficking awareness. We donated our human \ntrafficking awareness training for use in the broader \nhospitality workforce, and by the end of December, \nnearly 850,000 hotel workers outside of Marriott had also \ncompleted the training. In addition, Marriott engaged with \nthe Global Fund to End Modern Slavery (GFEMS) to create \na hospitality training curriculum for survivors of human \ntrafficking and successfully piloted the training, with \nplans to scale the curriculum with service providers in the \nyears ahead.\nResponding to Global Crises\nIn the midst of global crises, such as the war in Ukraine, \nour commitment to our communities remained strong, \nwith hotels in the Marriott portfolio, associates, and guests \nmobilizing and lending support.

As what \ndrives this disagreement is unclear, we examine whether a firm\u2019s ESG disclosure helps explain \nsome of this disagreement. We predict and find that greater ESG disclosure actually leads to \ngreater ESG rating disagreement. These findings hold using firm fixed effects, and using a \ndifference-in-differences design with mandatory ESG disclosure shocks. We also find that raters \ndisagree more about ESG outcome metrics than input metrics (policies), and that disclosure \nappears to amplify disagreement more for outcomes. Lastly, we examine consequences of ESG \ndisagreement and find that greater ESG disagreement is associated with higher return volatility, \nlarger absolute price movements, and a lower likelihood of issuing external financing. Overall, our \nfindings highlight that ESG disclosure generally exacerbates ESG rating disagreement rather than \nresolving it. \n \n \nKeywords: ESG Ratings; Rating Agency Disagreement; ESG Disclosure; Corporate Social \nResponsibility; Sustainability \nJEL Classification: G24, M14, M41, Q56 \nThe data used in this study are publicly available from the sources cited in the text \n________________________________________________________________________ \nWe thank Vishal Baloria, Mark Bradshaw, Mary Ellen Carter, Jeff Doyle, Jacquelyn Gillette, Michelle Hanlon, Amy \nHutton, Zach Kaplan, Kevin Koharki, Brad Lindsey, Christopher Noe, Kyle Peterson, Sugata Roychowdhury, Susan \nShu, Chad Simon, Chris Skousen, Eric So, Rodrigo Verdi, Joe Weber, and workshop participants at Boston College, \nHarvard Business School, MIT, Utah State University, and Washington University in St. Louis and the Bar-Ilan \nUniversity New Research on Executive Compensation and on Sustainability conference (2019) for useful comments \nand suggestions.

INTRODUCTION \n \nOne of the biggest developments in financial markets, in recent years, has been the \nintegration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) information in investment decisions. \nAccording to recent estimates, more than $30 trillion in assets under management are invested \nusing sustainable strategies that apply ESG criteria in investment analysis and portfolio selection \n(GSIA 2018). Seeking to capture ESG information that thousands of publicly listed firms \nincreasingly disclose, investor spending on ESG ratings from data providers (i.e., ESG rating \nagencies) increased from $200 million to $500 million between 2014 and 2018 (Gilbert 2019). \nIn line with the increased use of ESG ratings by market participants, a growing number of \nacademic studies have examined the association of ESG ratings with variables of interest, \nincluding stock market performance, accounting performance, financial constraints, and \ngovernance characteristics (e.g., Cheng, Ioannou, and Serafeim 2014; Khan, Serafeim, and Yoon \n2016; Hubbard, Christensen, and Graffin 2017).1 However, recently academic research (Chatterji \net al. 2016; Berg, Koelbel, and Rigobon 2020) and commentators in the media have questioned \nthese ratings noting the high degree of disagreement among data providers. For example, one Wall \nStreet Journal article noted, \u201cEnvironmental, social and governance criteria are hard to define. \nWhen we measure how different ESG providers rate companies in the S&P 500, there's often little \noverlap. By contrast, when ratings agencies score those same companies for their creditworthiness, \nthey are much more often in agreement\u201d (Sindreu and Kent 2018).2 Similarly, regulators have also \nvoiced concerns about the substantial disagreement in ESG ratings. Commissioner Peirce of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mentioned in a recent speech that \u201cthe different \n                                                           \n1 ESG ratings are evaluations of a company based on a comparative assessment of their quality, standard or \nperformance on environmental, social or governance (ESG) issues (Brackley, Petroy, and Wong 2019). \n2 For a simple illustration of this, see the graphi", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

This morning, we issued a press release and presentation slides, both of which can be\nfound on the Investors section of our website.\nBefore we start, please note that this presentation will include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.\nAs you know, since we started the company, we were already energized by our mission, which is to deliver on the promise of mRNA science to\ncreate a new generation of transformative medicines for patients. What was very clear to us, because mRNA is an information molecule, is that we\nhad potentially in our hands a platform, a platform that could be very impactful to better the world. And so as we thought about building the\ncompany, it was very important to us to think about how do we build a responsible company in the holistic sense of the world.\nAnd as you can see, the framework that is on the right of the slide, we developed a framework that is about, first, of course, medicines for patients,\nwhich I will come back to and the team as well; also making sure that we have, of course, great talent; that we are a responsible company within\nour community; but also a responsible company with regards to the environment; and then, of course, because we wanted to be here for the very\nlong term, to build very strong governance and ethics principles to make sure that we could build the best possible version of Moderna.\nSo that framework was shared in 2018, on the next slide. We also issued earlier this year our first ESG report, which we, of course, would love to\nhave your feedback and input as we'll try, as always, to improve it over time to make it as useful as we can to you, our partners, our shareholder.\nOur goal today is to give you a bit of a glimpse into our progress and also our team and our thinking so that we can get, again, a good dialogue\nwith you to help us take this to the next level.\n2\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92022 Refinitiv.

So as you know, of course, our #1 priority is to develop as many impactful\nmedicine, going after unmet medical need that we can. And as you know, we have a portfolio of vaccines for infection, which is in blue, and the\nportfolio of therapeutics. If you look at the vaccine portfolio, we are very excited about it, as you can see on the next slide because of what we can\ndo for patients around the world.\nOn Slide 8, please. It's basically the ability to prevent disease for literally hundreds of millions of people, prevent a lot of deaths, as you can see just\nright on the slide, and to make sure also that we can provide value to the health care system. We believe with aging of population, the current\ntrajectory of the health care system is not tenable. But we believe that Moderna can be part of a solution to prevent health care costs by preventing\ndisease. We want to turn the world from sick care, which it is today, not health care, to true health care, keeping people healthy.\nIf you go to the nex", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

In addition, we consider the feedback from key ESG raters.\nFor ease of locating disclosures by framework, we have included \nContent Indices at the back of this report on page 83. Unless \notherwise noted, the data and information reported are at a \ntotal enterprise level, for assets under our operational control \nand for calendar year 2021. Additionally, all currency references \nare in US dollars.\nValues in charts and tables may not sum to the total amounts \nshown due to rounding.\nSUPPORTING INDUSTRY EFFORTS FOR CONSISTENT AND \nCOMPARABLE REPORTING\nWe participate in several industry initiatives working to improve \nsustainability reporting. One such initiative is with API on its \nClimate-related Reporting Initiative. The aim of this initiative \nis to develop more consistent and comparable reporting of \nkey greenhouse gas (GHG) indicators in a template form for \nvoluntary use by individual companies. The initial version of the \ntemplate was released for use in 2021, and further details can be \nfound on the API website. For Murphy\u2019s API Template for GHG \nReporting, please see page 79. \nINTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASSURANCES\nWe recognize the importance of providing our stakeholders with \ncomplete and accurate data and information, and have therefore \ntaken the following steps in reviewing the content quality of this \nreport:\n\u2022\t\nInternal assurance \u2013 We streamlined our data collection \nactivities into an internally developed information system \nwith built-in internal control measures. Additionally, this \nreport was reviewed by a cross-functional management \nteam, subject matter experts and the executive leadership \nteam, as well as the Health, Safety, Environment and \nCorporate Responsibility (HSE&CR) Board Committee.\n\u2022\t\nExternal assurance \u2013 We engaged ERM Certification and \nVerification Services (ERM CVS) to conduct an independent \nassurance of our absolute 2021 total Scope 1 and Scope \n2 GHG emissions. For ERM CVS\u2019s Independent Assurance \nStatement, please see page 81.\nRESTATEMENTS\nAs we improve our sustainability reporting year-on-year, we \nnote that it may be necessary to restate our data. Reasons for \nrestatements could include changes in reporting boundaries, \nmetric definitions or calculation methodologies, or other \nreasons. For the sake of transparency, we will highlight the \nrestated items and reasons for restatement if we believe it would \nbe meaningful information.\nIn this year\u2019s report, we restated our 2020 gross operated Scope \n1 GHG emissions data and associated metrics. The primary \nreason for the revision was to correct the overreported flaring \nemissions for our Gulf of Mexico Delta House platform and BW \nPioneer Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) \nfacility. The overreporting was due to incorrect flaring emission \nfactors provided by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management \n(BOEM), which the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nMandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires offshore \noperators to use. The restatement resulted in the 2020 Scope 1 \nGHG emissions data being 14% lower than originally reported \nlast year. As described above, the restated Scope 1 data items \nare highlighted in the Performance Data section of this report on \npage 73. \nThe Murphy Oil Corporation 2022 Sustainability Report contains data and information \nregarding the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues essential to our \ninternal and external stakeholders. We have adopted the five reporting principles of \nrelevance, transparency, consistency, completeness and accuracy, as outlined in the \n\u201cSustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry, 4th Edition, 2020,\u201d \npublished jointly by the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation \nAssociation (Ipieca), the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the International \nAssociation of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP).

Also, please see \npage 30 for our Safe Harbor language.\nNORTHERN OIL & GAS, INC.\n\n1\nNOG is the largest U.S. publicly traded non-operated \nexploration and production company that engages in the \nacquisition, exploration, development and production of\noil and natural gas properties in the United States. Using a \nnon-operating model, we invest in minority working and \nmineral interests in oil and gas properties, with core focus areas \nin three premier U.S. basins: the Permian, Williston and \nAppalachian. The Company is listed on the New York Stock \nExchange (NYSE) under the symbol NOG. \nAs a non-operator, we are in a position to diversify our \ninvestment exposure by selectively participating with \nexperienced operators in the drilling of oil and gas wells.  In\naddition to our participation in new wells, NOG actively \npursues value enhancing acquisitions of existing producing \nproperties, many with the potential for further development. \nNOG actively seeks out operators who have significant oil and \ngas operating experience, including employing the expertise \nto adhere to high ESG and regulatory standards.\nIn 2021, we created an ESG Task Force charged with proposing, \nimplementing and monitoring adherence to ESG standards, \nand formally communicating its findings on an ongoing basis \nto our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and our Board of Directors \n(the \u201cBoard\u201d).

In this \nreport, we provide further transparency into our business practices and our steadfast \ncommitment to ensuring NOG\u2019s long-term sustainability. Directly supporting the \nCompany\u2019s ongoing success are the strategic oversight and support of our Board and \nour dedicated and talented team of employees. \nNOG holds oil and gas assets that are located in multiple prolific onshore basins in the \nUnited States.  As a non-operator, NOG does not have operational control over the \ndrilling and production on its properties.  However, we strive to participate with proven \nand responsible third-party operators that strictly adhere to and report under all \nrequired regulatory requirements. In addition, we are focused on promoting safe \noperations that minimize adverse impacts on the environment and personnel. Finally, \nwe seek to provide our employees with competitive and comprehensive compensation, \nbenefits, and professional development programs. \nWe take our commitment to promoting the long-term sustainability of NOG very\nseriously. A key driver of our success as a non-operator has been the execution of\ntargeted high rate-of-return initiatives designed to improve our position in the \nmarketplace. During 2021, we entered into four strategic acquisitions that helped us \nmaterially grow and diversify our business. We also substantially enhanced our financial \nposition and instituted a meaningful shareholder return of capital program. \nIn addition to supporting our stockholders, we are focused on ensuring we understand \nand meet the needs of our employees, business partners, and the wider community as \nwe develop and execute on our ESG initiatives.

Introduction \n \nIn 2017, NZX released the NZX Corporate Governance Code (the Code)1 for issuers to report \nagainst under the NZX Main Board Rules. The overarching purpose of Code is to promote good \ncorporate governance, recognising that boards are in place to protect the interests of \nshareholders and to provide long-term value. It operates on a \u2018comply or explain\u2019 basis.  The \nCode is structured around 8 principles that cover a code of ethics, board composition and \nperformance, board committees, reporting and disclosure, remuneration, risk management, \nauditors and shareholders rights and relations.  \nOne of the key aims of the Code is to promote issuer disclosure of environmental, social and \ngovernance factors (ESG). In particular, recommendation 4.3 states:  \n\u201cFinancial reporting should be balanced, clear and objective. An issuer should provide \nnon-financial disclosure at least annually, including considering material exposure to \nenvironmental, economic and social sustainability risks and other key risks. It should \nexplain how it plans to manage those risks and how operational or non-financial targets \nare measured.\u201d \nIssuers may include other non-financial information, such as a description of the performance of \nan issuer\u2019s business against strategic goals. Non-financial reporting is new under the NZX \nCorporate Governance Code. An explanation of the \u201ccomply or explain\u201d nature of the NZX Code \nis included on page 5 of the NZX Code. \nAims of this Guidance Note \nThis guidance note is for NZX listed issuers that are considering the disclosure of ESG factors \nunder the NZX Code. It is built on the understanding that most businesses will have some sort \nof interaction with one or more of the branches of ESG. While not exhaustive, this guidance \nnote aims to help issuers better understand the benefits of ESG reporting and the global \nreporting regimes available.  \nThe NZX ESG Guidance Note aims to: \n\u2022 \nexplain what ESG is; \n\u2022 \nprovide issuers context on why it is important (i.e. its relevance under the NZX Code and \ninvestor demand);  \n\u2022 \nprovide issuers with resources for accessing more information about how to report on \nESG factors, including which global frameworks are available to them; and  \n\u2022 \nhelp issuers communicate their strategies for identifying and managing their materially \nsignificant ESG opportunities and risks to stakeholders and investors. \n \n1 https://www.nzx.com/regulation/nzx-rules-guidance/corporate-governance-code \n\n \nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE \u2013 DECEMBER  2017 \n4 of 19 \nThis guidance should help issuers identify the most appropriate global framework against which \nto report of the most widely recognised and used in New Zealand. The global frameworks \nidentified are not exhaustive and NZX recognizes that other frameworks not discussed here \nmay also exist, or be developed or evolve over time.  \n2. Background \u2013 What is ESG?  \n \nThe use of ESG disclosure is becoming more important in relation to investment decisions \nalongside other financial and strategic information. Issuers can show investors that they are \nequipped for the long term, and are ready to respond to risks and take advantages of \nopportunities. \nThere are three elements that help socially conscious businesses measure their sustainability \nand the ethical impact of", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Multiple challenges arose in different \ncountries and forced us to be nimble, in order to overcome the pandemic \ncircumstances. Despite this complex environment, during 2020 we have \nachieved a remarkable performance. Watching events unfold throughout \nLetter from the Chairman of the Board\nthe year, we were keenly focused on what we, as a corporation, could do \nto serve. I am proud of what our company and our hundreds of employees \naround the world achieved, collectively and individually, as a global, \ncoordinated and diversified organization. Neolith has demonstrated its \nability to help our end customers to enhance their own spaces through a \nhigh-value surface which allows them to create beautiful places in which \nto spend their time.\nIn 2020, we dedicated much of our efforts in continue innovating, not \nonly in product but in services, increasing efficiency in operations and \ninternational growth, that will set the fundations of the tomorrow\u2019s \nNeolith. And because a better future is not possible without an intense \nfocus on sustainability issues as well as neighborhoods and communities, \nwe aligned our ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) strategy \nwith the vision of being a pioneer in the building materials industry \nbecoming a key aspect of our brand positioning.\nThis means that our contribution to the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs) is one of the most important topics we cover in our \nSustainability report for 2020. The world\u2019s economic and political issues, \nthe scarcity of natural resources, and the increase in global disasters \nresulting from climate change require the roadmap of governments, \nbusinesses, and civil society to be urgently adapted. Aligned with this \ninitiative, Neolith performed an internal and external evaluation of ESG \nconcepts over 2020, where we defined certain specific actions to ensure \nsustainable growth and the company\u2019s long-term future. Evaluating our \nESG strategic plan in the context of the SDGs, we found our business to be \nin support of nine of the goals with a significant contribution to climate \nchange, decent work, and responsible consumption and production. \nI would like to end this introduction by expressing my sincere gratitude \nfor the employees, management, distributors, partners and shareholders\u2019 \nefforts in supporting and contributing to our business project, and the \nexciting transformation our company will undergo in the coming years.\nSagi Cohen\nChairman of the Board\nESG@neolith.com\n\n017\n016\nAs my first year as Neolith CEO, I wanted to dedicate \nall my experience and energy to sustainability \nmatters in order to unleash the Group potential to \nstand out.\nAt Neolith, our aim is to improve quality of life by \nproviding functional, sustainable products that \nmake people feel good, both indoors and outdoors.\nIn terms of social actions, we have made amazing progress on our zero-\naccidents goal and have seen an outstanding improvement, moving us \ncloser to our target. We have also identified opportunities to support \nour social environment through donations to hospitals and charitable \ninstitutions: organisations working with those most in need in our \nvarious markets around the world.\nInitiatives such as Neolith Six-S, an all-new collection that we launched \nin the middle of the pandemic, offers enhanced design, high-tech \nfeatures and advanced hygiene. We achieved this without sacrificing \nsustainability, and maintained our commitment to building a better \nworld.\nThe fight against climate change requires coordinated efforts between \ncountries and businesses alike. Neolith must play an active role in this \ntransition, and so in 2019 we achieved Carbon Neutrality, once again \n", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The report \nwas a first-of-its-kind, data-driven investigation of the invisible workforce behind many of the \nclothes we wear, accessories we carry, and objects that decorate our homes. It aimed to shine \na light on the social and economic realities of the unseen individuals, primarily women, who \nsupport our global supply chains through both simple and highly-skilled handwork. Working \noutside of traditional factories, these individuals are often left unprotected and undervalued.\nSince 2006, Nest has championed the rights and interests of handworkers around the world \nthrough our grassroots programming and systems-change advocacy. Sitting at the intersection of \nartisan production and brand sourcing, we are the leading advocate of this powerful workforce.\nNest delivers many of our programs globally\u2014reaching artisans \nin more than 120 countries. However, there remains a unique \nneed for support among American makers in our own backyard. \nHearing the stories of local artists, makers, and creative \nentrepreneurs over the years, Nest was inspired to act. Many \nshared that access to the growing American Makers\u2019 Movement \nand the social and economic opportunities it offers were not \nshared equitably within communities and were often split by race \nand class.\nNest launched Makers United in 2018. The program is building a \nmore vibrant and inclusive Makers\u2019 Movement across the United \nStates by providing artists, makers, and creative entrepreneurs \nwho often face barriers to accessing the support they need with \nthe resources and market access opportunities they need to \nthrive. With a focus on elevating the voices of overlooked makers \nand delivering innovative market access solutions, Makers United \nis ensuring that the growing handmade craft movement sweeping \nthe country is generating opportunities for all regardless of \ngender, race, economic means, or physical ability.\nUntil recently meaningful data about this rapidly growing sector \nwas largely unavailable and disparate when it was. Over the \nlast four years, Nest has launched Makers United programming \nin 8 cities and two heritage craft communities, the Gee\u2019s Bend \nQuilters of Alabama and the Gullah Basket Weavers of the South \nCarolina Lowcountry. And, we have concurrently expanded \nour outreach to American creatives outside of these locations \nenabling us to establish one of the most comprehensive U.S. \nmaker datasets to date working with 1,045 makers in 36 states.\n \nAs you page through this report, you will glean quantitative and \nqualitative learnings from this dataset among others, as well as a \nnumber of corporate, philanthropic, and nonprofit leaders about \nthe social and economic status of the U.S. maker economy, and \nthe outsized impact investments in this sector can have.\nIt is my hope that this report will inspire you to join Nest in making \nmeaningful investments in the creative economy to increase \nemployment opportunities, advance social and economic \nequality, and preserve culture through craft. Together we can \nensure the American-made movement has an outsized impact \non the individuals, families, and communities.\n01 Introduction\nREBECCA VAN BERGEN\nFounder and Executive Director, Nest\n\n4 | The State of the Handworker Economy   \n02 Defining the US Artisan & Maker Economy\nThe maker and craft economy has witnessed accelerated growth in the past decade. This economy \nis largely informal and home-based. These factors, alongside the rapid growth, have led to a \nrange of terms used to refer to the individuals participating in this sector, as well as the sector as \na whole. Many of these terms are used interchangeably yet are subject to varying interpretations. \nIn order to align readers\u2019 perceptions of the terms used in this report, the following definitions \nwere developed for keywords:\nARTISAN\nWe draw our definition from UNESCO\u2019s definition of handcraft in which an artisan is defined as an individual working on the creation of products \nmade completely by hand or with the help of hand tools as long as the direct manual contribution of the maker remains the most substantial \ncomponent of the finished product. An artisan can also be referred to as a \u201ccraftsperson.\u201d For the purposes of this report, we define artisans as \nindividuals located both within and outside of the United States, though the data shared in this report is focused specifically on the United States.\nMAKER\nWe ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

An important analysis \nthat allowed us to understand that the use phase \nof our products is the part of the value chain that \naccounts for most of our emissions. Therefore, \nthis is the phase that we wish to focus on, to \nimprove the energy performance and environmental \nrequirements of our systems. \nAs part of this effort, starting in 2022 we are \nbenefiting from extending EPD certification (which \ndescribes the environmental performances of the \nlife cycles of products and services) to our entire \nproduction process in order to expand our range of \ngreen solutions.\nIn other words, we now have a precise snapshot of \nour footprint and can continue in the right direction: \nthat of greater respect for the environment.\nYet we could not make such important \ncommitments without an adequate governance \nstructure. We have created a sustainability function \nthat sets goals, monitors performance and ensures \nthat everyone has all the right tools to embark on \nthis journey.\nA journey we could not undertake without the \nfundamental contribution of our people. \nWe believe in an approach to work on a human \nscale that also takes into account the wellbeing \nof our employees, combining stable employment \n(95% of contracts are permanent) with the \npromotion of a healthy, active lifestyle. \nWe intend to continue in this direction even now \nthat we have over 3,000 Nice People.\nWe have become a large group, but above all we \nwant to be One Company: a closely knit team with \na shared vision and goals. \nWe want to expand our ability to include and \nharness diversity: to increase the presence \nof women in positions of leadership, bring \nmulticulturalism to all levels of the hierarchy, ensure \nequal employment and career opportunities to \npeople with disabilities and extend change across \nthe entire organisation.\nAt Nice, the foundations have been laid for a \nsustainable, inclusive new phase. \nIt is for this reason, among others, that the first \nreport is entitled: \u201cWelcome to the Nice Future\u201d. \nWe stand at the brink of a major change that poses \nmany challenges: in these pages, we aim to share \nwith you the milestones we have reached and the \nambitious goals that lie ahead of us.\nEnjoy your reading,\nLetter to our stakeholders\nLauro Buoro, \nFounder & Chairman\nRoberto Griffa, \nChief Executive Officer\nLauro Buoro\nFounder and Chairman\nRoberto Griffa\nChief Executive Officer\n\n6\n7\nContents\nLetter to our stakeholders \t  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  4 \nScenario \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  8                \n               \nNice to meet you  \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n10\n\t\nAbout us \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n12\n\t\nWhere we work \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n14\n\t\nOur history \t  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n18\n\t\nMain events in 2021 \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n20\n\t\nMission and values \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n22\n\t\nOur solutions \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n24\n\t\nOur projects \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n26\nThe Nice journey to sustainability \t\n\t\n\t\n28\n\t\nOur approach to sustainability \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n30\n\t\nStakeholder engagement \t \t\n \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n32\n\t\nStakeholder communication \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n34\n\t\nMateriality matrix \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n36\n\t\nOur goals \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n38\n\t\nThe Nice governance, strong company\t\n\t\n40\n\t\nGovernance bodies \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n42\n\t\nAnti-bribery and corruption procedures \t\t\n\t\n\t\n45\n\t\nCustomer privacy \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n46\n\t\nEnvironmental compliance \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n47\n\t\nSocioeconomic compliance  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n48\n\t\nTax strategy \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n48\n\t\nEconomic value generated and distributed\t\n\t\n\t\n50\nThe Nice environment, gentle footprint\t\n\t\n 52\n\t\nClimate action\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  54\n\t\nEnergy consumption \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  58\n\t\nSmart and home automation for the environment  \t\n\t\n  62\n\t\nMateri", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

It aims to lead the way in the \ndecarbonisation of the aerospace industry, to unite and \nsafeguard the citizens of the world, and continually expand \nhuman knowledge of our universe, from critical events on earth \nto the exploration of space. To this aim, the Company designs, \nmanufactures and delivers aerospace products, services and \nsolutions to customers on a worldwide scale bringing essential \nvalue to society and contributing to the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (\u201cSDGs\u201d) through its core business and \nhow it runs it.\nFirst of all, the Company connects. Connections are vital \nto making the world a better place. That\u2019s why the Company \nunites people and organisations across the globe; physically \nwith its commercial aircraft and helicopters; and virtually with its \nconnectivity solutions, allowing them to connect and understand \neach other.\nThe Company serves communities. Its satellites and tracking \nsystems help make oceans safer with solutions that monitor and \nprotect naval routes and maritime assets. Company-built aircraft \nare instrumental in firefighting, in maintaining energy systems and \npublic safety. Its helicopters are the workhorses that carry out \nconstruction and infrastructure projects in hostile or inaccessible \nareas of local communities as they can often be the only tool \nable to transport heavy loads, building materials, supplies, cargo \nand more. Technology solutions from the Company protect many \ncritical systems from cyberattacks.\nThe Company saves lives. When a humanitarian crisis arises, its \naircraft help transport patients for urgent medical care, and they \nassist in search efforts to find those marooned at sea, stranded \nin the mountains, or isolated in remote regions. Its EO satellites \nare tasked to acquire images of the concerned area. This imagery \nis delivered to relevant authorities, together with archived data, \nto rapidly assess the extent of damage and support rescue \nplanning by allowing actions to be prioritised, and identifying if \nroads, bridges and airport runways are still operational.\nThe Company protects. Its defence products and services help \ncountries protect their citizens, values and vital infrastructure. In \nan unstable world, this security is a prerequisite of peace, the rule \nof law, political stability, democracy, environmental sustainability, \nhuman rights, economic development and prosperity, and \nscientific progress. The Company manufactures helicopters, \nfighter jets and military transport planes that allow nations to \nsafeguard their airspace and respond to natural disasters. \nThe Company supplies intelligence capabilities as well as \nterrestrial space and cyber security services. It provides secure \ncommunications to governments and organisations devoted \nto public safety. All help to make the world a safer place. Its \ndefence activities contribute to diplomacy, conflict resolution and \na multilateral approach to international relations. By supplying \nEU and NATO member states with advanced military equipment, \nit strengthens their diplomatic influence and credibility on the \nglobal stage \u2013 and in turn that of international institutions such \nas the UN and NATO, thereby contributing to SDG 16\u00a0\u2013 Peace, \nJustice and Strong Institutions.\nThe Company explores. It believes the exploration of our \nuniverse will enrich life for generations to come. Its space \ntechnologies and satellite imagery solutions continually expand \nhuman knowledge of our universe, from the ability to capture \nand analyse data on climate change and critical events on Earth, \nto providing the solutions that enable deep-space exploration. \nFor decades, the Company has been at the very heart of space \nexploration. It\u2019s at the forefront of creating the technologies that \nallow mankind to send spacecraft to planets, moons and comets \nboth near our sun and millions of kilometres away.\nGENERAL\nGRI\nSDGs\nOthers\n102 General Disclosures\n4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 17\nVigilance Plan\nHighest governance body(ies) involved\nBoard of Directors\u00a0/ ECSC\nExecutive Committee supported by topic-focused Committees\nCommitments to external frameworks\nUN Global Compact, The Ten Principles, Sustainable Development Goals\nAdd. ressources\n\u2009: this symbol indicates a link  \nto an external website\nSustainability on Airbus.com\n, Airbus Tax Strategy\nInnovation contributing to a more sustainable world on\n Airbus.com\n, Earth monitoring \nand\u00a0understanding\n (e.g. Climate change monitoring\n, Application for sustainable agriculture)\n\u200c, \nExample partnership for\u00a0innovation: ANITI project\n, Toulouse University (ANITI)\n,  \nThe Future of\u00a0Hydrogen by the IEA\n,\nATAG Benefits Beyond Borders fact sheet\n, ASD Fact Sheet 2021\nUN Global Compa", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

On behalf of the Board, I thank all our employees, \nespecially the crews onboard our vessels, for their unwavering professionalism, dedication, \nand stamina during these uncertain times.\nOur people\u2019s hard work, commitment, and diligence proved critical in delivering industry-\nleading operating results and record financial results in 2022, which translate to significant value \ncreation for our shareholders. While our performance benefitted from a strong market rebound, \nespecially in the second half of the year, our counter-cyclical investments in state-of-the-art, \nEco and scrubber-fitted vessels set us apart from the competition and drive shareholder value \nboth in absolute and relative terms. Our plan for 2023 calls for enhanced focus on strategic \ninitiatives that include, first and foremost, operational safety, adroit vessel trading, solid financial \nperformance, and shareholder value creation.\n2022 started on a weak footing for our markets, mainly due to weak trade demand for \nglobal seaborne crude oil amid the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant, renewed \nimplementation of mobility restriction policies, primarily in China, and further lagging of the \nOPEC output versus quotas during the seasonally muted first quarter. In addition, the continued \ngrowth of tonnage supply, following the delivery of the remaining vessels ordered during the \nhistorically busy 2018 through 2020 period, further curtailed the short-term fundamentals for the \nlarge crude tanker market at the time.\nNotwithstanding the soft start, the crude tanker market improved markedly since February 2022 \nfor the Suezmax and Aframax vessels, while gains in the VLCCs occurred during the second half \nof 2022. In particular, the Russian invasion of Ukraine during the first quarter and the subsequent \nimposition of Russian crude oil sanctions by the EU, UK, and the US, have resulted in significant \ntrade complexity and rerouting of crude oil voyages. During the first months of the invasion, the \nAframax and Suezmax vessels, the dominant pre-war asset classes chartered for the seaborne \ntransportation of Russian oil, realized initial spikes in freight rates. By contrast, the large crude \ntanker fleet concentrated in the West as Europe rushed to secure non-Russian replacement \nbarrels. Due to the Chinese lockdown, the combination of VLCC fleet dislocation in the West, \nand limited fronthaul cargoes towards the East resulted in downward pressure on charter rates \nthat proved transitory.\nSource: Company filings, OET.\nVLCC\nSuezmax\nOET\nPeer A\nPeer B\nPeer C\nPeer D\nOET\nPeer A\nPeer B\nPeer C\nPeer D\n$37,937\n$54,851\nFull year 2022 Spot TCE performance ($/day)\n60,000 $pd\n55,000\n50,000\n45,000\n40,000\n35,000\n30,000\n25,000\n20,000\n\n5\nOKEANIS ECO TANKERS      2022 ANNUAL REPORT\nLETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN\nFollowing the initial shock, new trade lanes emerged and absorbed tonnage.

It has highlighted the \nprecarious nature of the international supply \nchains, the tendency of nation state protec-\ntionism over collectivism in crisis, and ultimately \nthe sheer importance of humanity in every-\nthing we do. Shareholders and stakeholders \nhave realised that only a balanced approach \nbetween sustainability and commercial viabil-\nity has a future in today\u2019s world and sits high \non the agenda in every board room discussion. \nThis year, along with our technical manage-\nment provider, Kyklades Maritime Corpora-\ntion, we demonstrated sincere efforts to lever-\nage ESG practices at the heart of our opera-\ntions and actions. Despite turbulent last years \nfor the entire marine transportation sector due \nto Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, Okeanis Eco \nTankers managed to maintain its business \ncontinuity as well as its seafarer\u2019s health, safety \nand wellbeing. I would like to take this oppor-\ntunity to express once again our deepest grat-\nitude especially to the crews onboard our ves-\nsels for their unwavering professionalism, ded-\nication, and stamina during these uncertain \ntimes. Vigilant around social responsibility, we \nwill strive to improve further our work environ-\nment for all our employees embracing safety, \ndiversity and inclusion.\n2021 marks a decade of policies and measures \nfocused on cutting greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom seaborne transportation. We are now in a \ndecade of action. Our industry, together with \ngovernments from around the world, and soci-\nety stakeholders have come together as a uni-\nfied community with a commitment to oper-\nate on a strictly limited carbon footprint. While \nit is clear that we cannot wait until 2030 to posi-\ntion for net zero target in mid century.  Ship-\nping continues to be critical to the facilitation \nof world trade. However, it is an industry where \nthe positives are often ignored, yet the prob-\nlems regularly highlighted.\nAt OET, we are acutely aware of our respon-\nsibility to be part of these efforts and comply \nwith sustainable investment practices. We can \nproudly state that we have had a head start \nvis-\u00e0-vis GHG emissions relative to market and \npeers thanks to our investment in young, ECO \nvessels built at world class yards. Since incep-\ntion, and together with our managers, we are \nclosely monitoring our ESG performance met-\nrics.  \nKyklades Maritime Corporation as early as 2014, \ndesigned and developed an in-house Moni\u00ad\ntoring and Performance System, an innova-\ntive monitoring tool capable of meeting cur-\nrent and future GHG regulatory and compli-\nance requirements through real-time vessel \nemissions reporting. Now, at OET, we are tak-\ning the next step in our decarbonization jour-\nney by publishing our results for the past year \nand setting our targets for a sustainable future.  \nOver the next year, we will be conducting a \nMateriality and Climate Risk session to fur-\nther identify climate risks and understand \ntheir interaction with investment decisions. In \nline with above targets we have signed our \nfirst sustainability linked loan, as of the date of \nthis report, acknowledging climate risk as an \ninvestment risk. Taking these proactive steps, \nwe firmly believe, will provide long-term, strong \nyields to our investors and partners. \nOur continued efforts in establishing and \nimplementing sustainable development prin-\nciples and responsible business operations will \nlead us to achieve more in our sustainability \njourney, so that we ensure our commitments \nand initiatives are robust enough to deal with \nglobal sustainability challenges as well as to \nconfront any potential crisis. \nThe past year we draw courage and inspiration \nfrom our committed workforce, managed to \nfulfil our stakeholders\u2019 expectations and satisfy \nour clients\u2019 needs. I am thankful to our excep-\ntional Team as well as its performance and \nwelcome you to travel with us through our \n2021 ESG Report. \nIoannis Alafouzos \nChairman, CEO \nOkeanis Eco Tankers\n\nAgenda\n2021 Highlights\nAbout this report\nOkeanis Eco Tankers at a glance\nMission, Vision, Values and Strategy\nFleet\nShipmanagement \nUN Sustainable Development Goals\nStakeholder Mapping\nESG Targets 2022\nMaritime industry ESG landscape\nEnvironment\nSociety\nGovernance\nAppendix\n4\n5\n6 \n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n16\n22\n30\n35\n\n2.04 gCO2/ton-mile AER\n422,848 MT CO2 eq.

We have come very \nfar in our transformation of METRO AG into a reliable \npartner for small and medium-sized hospitality and \nretail businesses.

We achieved this despite consider\u00ad\nable negative macroeconomic volatility in individual \nmarkets, such as Russia. The re-evaluation of market \nconditions in Russia and the inevitable termination  \nof the agreement between Real and Verdi forced us \nto correct our outlook in April 2018. This was a pain-\nful decision that cost us capital market confidence. \nThanks to the measures initiated for our Russian busi-\nness, we were able to prove in the second half of the \nyear that we can tackle and solve concrete problems, \nwhich has helped us make progress since.\nAt the end of the financial year, we decided to sell \nour hypermarket business. This move constitutes an \nimportant step in our project of fully focus ourselves \nto wholesale. We have put in place the best condi-\ntions to give Real a successful, independent future on \nits own. Besides the Food Lover concept and the \nstrong online presence, securing competitive cost \nstructures was an important, groundbreaking step.\nWe will propose a dividend of \u20ac0.70 per share at the \nAnnual General Meeting of METRO AG.

Leveraging the \ncompetitive advantages arising from its globalised and \nintegrated operations, it fully integrated environmental, \nsocial \nand \ngovernance \n(ESG) \nconcepts \ninto \nits \nbusiness operations, deepened its ESG practices, and \ndevoted itself to promoting win-win cooperation with \nstakeholders and creating sustainable value for the \nenvironment, society and economy.\nEnvironmental Responsibilities\nGovernance\nIn the first half of 2022, the Board of Directors assessed \nthe implementation progress of the Bank\u2019s 14th Five-\nYear Plan for Green Finance, reviewed its corporate \nsocial responsibility report (ESG) and, for the first time, \npublished annual disclosures in line with the Task \nForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \nrecommendations and the Principles for Responsible \nBanking (PRB). The steering group for green finance \nand industry planning and development headed by \nthe Bank\u2019s Chairman held two themed meetings to \nstudy national policies and guidance related to \u201ccarbon \npeak and carbon neutrality\u201d. At the same time, it \napproved the 2022 Work Plan for Green Finance of \nBank of China. The Green Finance Committee, chaired \nby the Bank\u2019s President, also achieved progress on \nseveral fronts. It reviewed developments including a \nreport on the greenhouse gas emissions calculation \nof the Group\u2019s operations, the launch of its green \ncredit system and progress in its pilot energy-saving \ntransformation programme; approved the Management \nMeasures for Assessment of Domestic Green Finance \nModel Companies of Bank of China, and formulated \na differentiated assessment system, management \nmechanism and supporting measures for the Group\u2019s \ndomestic branches. Moreover, the senior management \nheld several themed meetings to review and discuss \nmatters concerning external ESG assessment, green \noperations and climate risk stress testing.\nPolicy System\nThe Bank refined its preferential policies to support the \ndevelopment of its green finance business. It formulated \ncustomer marketing and credit review guidelines for \nindustrial chains such as lithium-ion power batteries, \nphotovoltaic manufacturing, sewage treatment and \nthe upstream chain of new energy vehicles; introduced \nnew credit policies for hydrogen energy and fuel cells, \nnew energy metals, water and water environment \ntreatment, forestry and other industries; and imposed \nmeasures to stop funding customers or projects that \nengage in illegal logging of natural forests, harm to \nbiodiversity, or the poaching of wild animals, etc. \nThe Bank also strengthened assessment guidance by \nincorporating green finance-related indicators into the \nperformance assessment of its senior management \nmembers, linking the results to their remuneration. \nAt the same time, it enhanced resource support for \nits green finance businesses by optimising economic \ncapital \nmanagement, \nimplementing \npreferential \npricing, adopting differentiated authorisation regimes, \nestablishing green approval channels, adjusting industry \ncredit strategies, allocating designated staff funds, and \nimproving reward systems.\nEnvironmental Risk Management\nThe Bank proactively implemented the concept of \nresponsible investment. In the first half of 2022, \nthe Bank added a qualitative statement of its \nenvironmental and social risk appetite to its overall \nrisk appetite statement. The Risk Policy Committee \nof the Board of Directors regularly reviewed the \nBank\u2019s progress in environmental and social risk \n\n67\nBank of China Limited\u2003 2022 Interim Report\nmanagement.

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "FY 202\nAnnual Report\n& Proxy Statement\n2\n\n\n \n \nDear Stockholders, \n \nThank you for your partnership and support over the preceding year. Fiscal year 2022 (FY22) was hallmarked by \naccelerated top line growth with four quarters of high-quality execution, increased velocity of innovation, continued \ncategory leadership in Incident Response, and growth across new products for Automation, AIOps and Customer \nService Ops.  \n \nWe achieved exceptional results across FY22, driven by long-term tailwinds of cloud adoption, DevOps \ntransformation, digital acceleration, and the increasing appetite for automation in light of rising costs and a tight \ntalent market. PagerDuty\u2019s Operations Cloud, built on the foundation of our digital operations platform and \nextended by our integration ecosystem, is rapidly becoming a standard for modern enterprises. PagerDuty is now the \nstrategic platform supporting our customers\u2019 growth strategies, as they advance their digital maturity in service of \ntheir business and financial goals. \n \nWe closed FY22 with total revenue at $281 million, growing 32% year over year compared to 28% in fiscal year \n2021 (FY21). We ended the year with annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $326 million. Over one million users \nacross more than 20,000 free and paid customers now place their trust in PagerDuty to drive their digital \ntransformation and maintain the integrity of their operations. Our dollar-based net retention remained above our \ntarget rate of 120% across all four quarters of the fiscal year. \n \nStrong demand and a favorable competitive environment led our customers to adopt multiple products. ARR for \nboth Event Intelligence and Automation grew at 70% or more year over year. Customer Service Operations grew at \nan even higher pace, with several high-value deals closed in the second half of FY22. More than 50% of our ARR \nnow comes from customers utilizing two or more PagerDuty products. We expect this multi-product trend to \ncontinue across FY23 as we build on our foundation for durable and sustainable growth. \n \nWe also continued to expand significantly with our enterprise customers. In FY22, customers spending more than \n$100,000 in ARR with PagerDuty grew 39% year over year to 594; those spending more than $1,000,000 increased \nto 43, up 65% compared to FY21. We are closing larger and more comprehensive deals, and as PagerDuty \ncustomers realize rapid time to value, they expand their use of the platform beyond DevOps teams, and upgrade to \nadvanced functionality, delivering compounding return on investment. The continued shift towards a digital-first \norientation across industries creates opportunities for increased penetration within all customer verticals.

We\u2019ve established a stronger \nfocus on decarbonization, including emissions \nreduction targets that have been validated by the \nScience Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets \ninclude PPG\u2019s first scope 3 emissions reduction \ntarget, an ambitious goal that will require working with \npartners throughout our value chain to collaborate on \ngreenhouse gas reduction strategies. The full set of \n2030 targets are outlined in more detail in this report.\nWe succeed by helping our customers succeed, \npartnering with them to create industry-leading \nsustainable innovations that help improve productivity. \nFor example, we\u2019re working alongside Steelcase, \nan American manufacturer of architecture, furniture \nand technology products, to identify new uses for \nwaste from our industrial coatings and support the \ncircular economy. Last year, we made approximately \n250,000 pounds of recycled coatings from powder \ncoatings used by Steelcase by reclaiming overspray \nthat would have otherwise been sent to a landfill. \nWhile we\u2019ve recently partnered with customers on \nnew, industry-leading technologies, our sustainable \ninnovations span decades.

In addition, the non-financial \ngroup report is intended to help analyze the \nopportunities and risks associated with these \naspects. \nThis non-financial group report of Porsche SE for \nthe fiscal year 2020 follows the commercial law \nrequirements of Sec. 315b German Commercial \nCode (HGB). In accordance with Sec. 289d HGB, it \nwas considered which national, European or \ninternational frameworks could be used for the \npreparation of the non-financial group report. The \nPorsche SE Group currently opts not to use a \nframework on account of deviating definitions of \nmateriality between the frameworks and the legal \nrequirements as well as the unreasonable cost-\nbenefit ratio in light of the current corporate \nstructure. The future use of a framework will be \nregularly evaluated; in particular, the current \nassessment may change with the acquisition of \nadditional investments. \n \n \nReporting covers Porsche SE and the fully \nconsolidated entities included in the consolidated \nfinancial statements of the Porsche SE Group and \nparticularly the companies of PTV Group. The \nPorsche SE Group does not have control over its \nother investments, meaning that it can encourage \nsustainable corporate governance at these \ninvestments only through the shareholder dialogue \nand board work. With regard to the investment in \nVolkswagen, reference is made to the Volkswagen \nGroup\u2019s own sustainability reporting. \nReporting on the Porsche SE Group mainly focuses \non the non-financial aspects environmental matters, \nemployee-related matters, social matters, respect \nfor human rights and anti-corruption and bribery \nmatters. \n \n \n2\n\n2020\nNon-financial group report\nof Porsche SE\nBusiness model of the  \nPorsche SE Group \nPorsche SE is a holding company with investments \nin the areas of mobility and industrial technology. \nThe investment in Volkswagen AG remains Porsche \nSE\u2019s core investment. In addition to this, Porsche \nSE aims to acquire additional investments related to \nindustrial production or the future of mobility in \norder to generate sustainable returns through active \ninvestment management. \nWhen it comes to identifying, implementing and \nfurther developing investment projects, Porsche SE \ndraws on its integration into one of the world's \nlargest automotive and industrial networks. \nThe Porsche SE Group is, in general, organized \nalong decentralized lines, the management of each \ninvestment is independently responsible for \ncorporate governance. Porsche SE is in constant \ncommunication with the management of its \ninvestments, particularly through its board work. \nBefore acquiring investments, Porsche SE \nconsiders how the target company manages non-\nfinancial aspects in addition to financial aspects. \nThe scope of these investigations depends \nconsiderably on the company\u2019s business model  \nand market coverage. \n \n \n \nIn addition to the core investment in Volkswagen, \nthe Porsche SE Group has over the past few years \ninvested in several companies that have significant \nsustainability aspects anchored in their respective \nbusiness models. With the data portfolio they offer \nand their software solutions, the PTV Group and \nINRIX are aiming to optimize traffic and routes, \nthereby making a significant contribution to \nreducing the consumption of resources and \nlowering emissions. The innovative 3D printing \nsolutions of two of our investments should allow \nraw materials to be used more efficiently in \ndevelopment and production. \n \n \n3\n\nMateriality analysis \nA materiality analysis was performed during \npreparation of the non-financial group report of \nPorsche SE. As a result, the aspects employee-\nrelated matters and anti-corruption and bribery \nmatters (compliance) were classified as material for \nthe Porsche SE Group. \nThe Porsche SE Group also attaches great \nimportance to the aspects environmental matters, \nsocial matters and respect for human rights. \nHowever, none of the companies relevant for the \nnon-financial reporting are from manufacturing or \ncommodity- and energy-intensive industries, which \nis why these aspects have been classified as \nimmaterial for the Porsche SE Group in this context. \nNevertheless, the Porsche SE Group considers \nthese aspects in its investment management and \nalso takes all of these into account in due diligence \nactivities before an investment. \nThere are currently no non-financial key \nperformance indicators that are material for the \nbusiness activities of the Porsche SE Group.  \nMaterial non-financial aspects \nEmployee-related matters \nThe qualification, motivation and efficiency of the \nPorsche SE Group\u2019s employees are key factors for \nits success.

The highlight of the year \nwas without a doubt the acquisition of 25% plus one share of the ordinary shares of Porsche AG. With \nthis investment, we added to our portfolio a company with strong growth and high dividends that is \nuniquely positioned in the sport and luxury segments of the automotive industry. Porsche SE has thus \nobtained a second core investment alongside the voting majority in its core investment Volkswagen AG \nand a portfolio of innovative technology companies, creating sustainable value for our shareholders. \nThe earnings figures of Porsche SE for the fiscal year 2022 are also very encouraging. We raised our \ngroup result after tax to 4.8 billion euro (prior year: 4.6 billion euro). This group result after tax was \nsignificantly influenced by the result of our core investment in Volkswagen AG accounted for at equity of \n4.5 billion euro. Overall, the Volkswagen Group developed positively, despite the lingering consequences \nof the Covid-19 pandemic, the war against Ukraine, supply chain problems and inflation. Porsche AG \nalso closed the fiscal year 2022 very successfully. Following the acquisition of ordinary shares in \nPorsche AG, the result of the Porsche SE Group will be more strongly influenced in the future by the \nearnings situation of the Porsche AG Group.  \nNet liquidity of the Porsche SE Group amounted to minus 6.7 billion euro as of 31 December 2022, \ncompared to 641 million euro at the end of 2021. This primarily reflects the roughly 7.1 billion euro in \ndebt capital we borrowed to purchase the ordinary shares in Porsche AG. I firmly believe: The \nacquisition of this second core investment is a very important step for our company towards creating \nsustainable value. \nWith our portfolio investments, we are systematically implementing our strategy and have joined forces \nwith strong partners to drive forward the development of our investments. Our holding in PTV is a good \nexample of this. Together with our partner Bridgepoint, we have strengthened the product portfolio of \nthe company by purchasing further assets. Moreover, the strategic realignment of the mobility and \nlogistics divisions has created the basis for future growth.  \nWe plan to expand our portfolio activity in the current fiscal year by identifying further promising \ncompanies. At the beginning of 2023, we were already able to bolster our portfolio with new investments. \nThese include, for example, our stake in ABB E-mobility, one of the world\u2019s leading providers of charging \nsolutions for electric vehicles.  \n \n10\n2022\nTo our shareholders\nLetter to our shareholders\n\nHans Dieter P\u00f6tsch\nChairman of the board\nof management\nOn the legal side of things, we were able to achieve two m", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The path out of the COVID-19 pandemic for our economic and social system had a \nmajor impact on the trajectory of the company, which managed to relaunch its commercial \ncapability, along with its determination to invest in growth and development.\nThe decision to take the company off the stock market should be interpreted in this sense, \nas the starting point of the owners\u2019 desire to guide the Group towards its future path \nwith ever greater willingness and commitment. Although this exit freed us from reporting \nobligations, we still wished to report on our activities, goals and results with regard to \nsustainability, continuing a commitment that remains central to our corporate mission.\nIndeed, corporate responsibility and sustainability are among the cornerstones of this \nmission. This led to: \na) continued investment in thin slabs, a product that is highly sustainable and in which we \nhave been one of the pioneering ceramic companies;\nb) a renewed commitment to provide products for healthy and safe environments with \nour unique Protect\u00ae antibacterial technology;\nc) the launch of an ambitious Sustainability Plan, which includes a series of important initiatives \nand goals to achieve in the medium term, covering 3 fronts: Planet, Prosperity and People.\nPeople continue to be one of the mainstays of our entrepreneurial work.

By remaining laser-focused on our purpose, we were able to \nachieve unprecedented progress in helping to address some of the world\u2019s \nmost pressing challenges. I also realize there is still more we need to \ndo, significant inequities that must be overcome, and real threats to our \nsociety and environment that lie ahead. I am confident we can rise to any \nchallenge, just as we have in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nMy confidence is grounded in my belief that Pfizer is fundamentally a \ndifferent company today than it was just two years ago. By applying the \nlessons learned from our work to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and oral \ntreatment1, and by further embedding Environmental, Social & Governance \n(ESG) principles into our core operations, we have transformed the way \nwe discover, develop, finance, and deliver breakthroughs that change \npatients\u2019 lives. At the same time, external forces transforming societal and \nenvironmental norms, along with our internal commitment to equity as \none of our core values, have reinforced the importance of integrating ESG \ninto our day-to-day activities. \nIn 2021, we continued to focus on ways to make a meaningful and \nmeasurable impact. Never before has our impact been so wide-reaching \nwhen it comes to the number of patients treated or vaccinated with a Pfizer \nproduct. We reached an estimated 1.4 billion1 patients with our medicines \nand vaccines \u2013 roughly one out of every six people on Earth. Even when \nwe separate out our breakthrough COVID-19 products, we treated an \nestimated 424 million patients globally.\nOur ESG strategy includes six priority areas: product innovation; equitable \naccess and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and \ninclusion; climate change; and business ethics. Our progress on these \nareas is detailed in this report, and we look forward to engaging with \ncolleagues and other stakeholders to hear how we can continue to \nenhance our impact, both within and outside of Pfizer. We also continue \nto refine the metrics we use to measure our performance as the voluntary \nand emerging regulatory frameworks governing ESG reporting evolve at \nthe national, regional and global level. \nBreakthroughs and bold ambition\nThe significance of \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d has never been clearer than it is today \nas we continue to face COVID-19 variants and as unacceptable rates of \nmorbidity and mortality from the virus endure. We are unwavering in our \ncommitment to applying science and the dedication of our workforce to help \nend the pandemic and address inequities.  \nWe also recognize that even as some people have received a booster dose \nof our vaccine, others are still waiting for their initial dose. We continue to \nbelieve we will more rapidly reach more people with our COVID-19 vaccine \nby continuing to scale our manufacturing capacity while maintaining quality \nand safety through the last mile.

As a member of the \nUN Global Compact, Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group is highly committed to implementing the \nUN Global Compact\u2019s ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the \nenvironment and anti-corruption throughout the Group when designing our business \nprocesses and strategies. In 2014, we developed a range of initiatives in conjunction \nwith the Global Compact\u2019s ten principles:  \nESG Best Practice Guide \nIn September 2013, Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group launched the ESG Practice Guide. The \nGuide contains seven recommendations on a comprehensive approach to capital \nmarket communications regarding sustainability. It offers practical guidance to \nenable companies to pursue an integrated and investor-focused reporting approach. \nAdherence to the Guide is voluntary; it does not include any binding reporting or \nadmission requirements. Rather, its aim is to familiarise investors with capital \nmarkets communication regarding sustainability, and to encourage them to engage \nwith the topic. In 2014, a survey on ESG reporting was launched for the German \ncapital market in close cooperation with the BVI (German Investment Funds \nAssociation), the Deutsches Aktieninstitut (German Share Institute), the Deutscher \nInvestor Relations Verband e.V. (DIRK) and the Verband der Investment \nProfessionals in Deutschland (Society of Investment Professionals in Germany, \nDVFA e.V.). Focal points of the survey were the preparation of the questioned \ncompanies for the impending EU directive on the publication of non-financial \ninformation as well as the preparation of the ESG Best Practice Guide. \nInformation media and transparency \nWith its range of risk management services, Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group aims to make a \nsustainable contribution to society, in particular by ensuring integrity and safety on \nthe markets in its function as a capital markets organiser and by increasing the \ndistribution efficiency of the markets through its price discovery function. \nThe Leipzig-based European Energy Exchange (EEX) operates a regulated and \ntransparent marketplace for trading greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions certificates. In \nSeptember 2014, EEX launched a new transparency website: at www.eex-\ntransparency.com, users can access comprehensive fundamental data and \ninformation relevant to wholesale energy trading. The website updates the previous \nEEX transparency platform, \u201cTransparency in Energy Markets\u201d, and provides \ninformation on the capacity, use and availability of power-generating plants. In \naddition, it gives details of power storage and natural gas consumption. As a result, \nthe website expands EEX\u2019s offering for market participants, allowing them to make \ntimely and effective disclosures in accordance with the EU regulation on wholesale \nenergy market integrity and transparency (REMIT). \n\nJoining the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative (SSE) \nAs the central point of contact between capital market participants, Deutsche B\u00f6rse \nGroup sees its responsibility as promoting market transparency, in particular \nexpanding the availability and quality of environmental, social and governance \n(ESG) information and increasing understanding of their relevance.  \nAgainst this backdrop, Deutsche B\u00f6rse joined the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Stock \nExchanges initiative (SSE) in early October of 2014. The aim of the initiative, \nfounded by the UN Secretary-General in 2009, is to promote international dialogue \non the sustainability of financial markets among exchange organisations. Deutsche \nB\u00f6rse Group is committed to its professed goals of defining the role of capital market \ninfrastructure providers within the sustainability movement and of dovetailing the \nSSE with parallel initiatives. \nGlobal employee survey \nAt the end of 2013, Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group conducted an employee survey, in which \n81.6 per cent of the workforce took part. From the employees\u2019 perspective, the \nGroup\u2019s strengths are customer focus, product and service quality and the working \nenvironment. At the same time, the survey identified a total of about 400 follow-up \nmeasures, which have been launched at group, segment, or department level to \naddress the perceived areas for improvement. According to feedback received from \nmanagers, 80 per cent of the defined measures had been implemented by the end \nof the year. The Group also benefited from the results of the survey in the  \narea of staff management. Over a period of three weeks, more than 1,000 \nemployees visited \u201cPeople Principles\u201d, an internal online forum, where they \ndiscussed guidelines for ethical behaviour among  colleagues. The principles the \ndiscussion highlighted as the most important for employees will be implemented in \nthe company through workshops and other initiatives from the beginning of 2015 \nonwards in order to put them into practice in everyday work. \nCode of conduct", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}}}}

Funds raised were loaned to farmers, soy was planted and harvested, and this \nreport summarises the impacts of the Facility during this first crop cycle. \n3   RCF annual report: crop season 2022:2023\nGlobal demand for soy production is driving significant deforestation,\u201d said Susan Gardner, Director, Ecosystems \nDivision at UN Environment Programme. \u201cPractical financial solutions like the Responsible Commodities Facility \nincentivise farmers to decouple commodity production from deforestation and land conversion practices, leading \nto enhanced landscape restoration, climate mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity protection in line with the \nUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. A great example \nof how farmers can be effectively incentivized would be for all the companies that have signed up to the Cerrado \nManifesto Statement of Support to materialise this commitment through funding this facility.\u201d\nExecutive summary\n1\n\nOverview of impacts for year 1\n32 \nfarms\nZero \ndeforestation or \nconversion of any \nnative vegetation\n42,400 tonnes \nof vDCF soy \nproduced in the \nmain crop season\n \n8,541 ha \nof native vegetation \nconserved in \nthe Cerrado\n2.90 MtCO2\ncarbon stocks in \nnative vegetation \nprotected by the RCF\n27,000 tonnes \nof DCF maize and 3,200 \ntonnes of DCF cotton \nproduced in the winter \ncrop (\u201csafrinha\u201d) preceding \nthe soy planting season\n2,145 ha \nof native vegetation \nconserved in excess \nof legal reserve \nrequirement\n0 t CO2 \nemitted from land \nuse change (0 t CO2/\nt soy produced)\nZero\nfinancial default \non repayment \nof loans\n4   RCF annual report: crop season 2022:2023\n\n5   RCF annual report: crop season 2022:2023\nThe Responsible \nCommodities \nFacility\n2\n\n6   RCF annual report: crop season 2022:2023\n2.1 Context \nGrowing demand for soy globally is resulting in a continuous expansion of the area under cultivation in Brazil. \nThis expansion has been identified as a major driver of deforestation, resulting in substantial destruction of natural \nhabitats, loss of biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions. The Amazon Soy Moratorium has significantly reduced \ndeforestation in the Amazon, but this has resulted in leakage of deforestation and conversion activities to a species \nrich tropical savanna known as the Cerrado1. More than 50% of the native vegetation in the Cerrado has now been \ncleared and over the last decade in the Matopiba region, 0.5\u20130.8 Mha of soy has been planted on recently converted \nland each year2.\nDemand-side calls to action such as the 2017 Cerrado Manifesto3 have raised the profile of the Cerrado amongst food \nretailers, food manufacturers and food service companies that have soy embedded in their products, and more recent \ninitiatives such as the Innovative Finance for the Amazon, Cerrado and Chaco (IFACC)4, Forest Positive Coalition of the \nConsumer Goods Forum5 and the UK and French Soy Manifestos, all share the objective of driving deforestation \u2013 \nand conversion-free (DCF) soy production in the region. Alongside this, in December 2022, the EU reached an \nagreement on a new law to prevent companies from placing commodities linked with deforestation and forest \ndegradation onto the EU market, or exporting them from the EU, known as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). \nWhile the regu", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

On the other hand, \nit is our starting point of reference for the coming years to impartially measure \nthe effectiveness of our efforts to achieve climate neutrality, demonstrate \nsocial responsibility in what we do as an institution and as people, and actively \ncare for transparency of our structures, management mechanisms, and our \nmost precious value: our employees. And finally, we have launched the ESG \nreporting in the year our Bank celebrates its 30th anniversary. This is the \nturning point and the best possible moment to clearly mark the beginning \nof a new period of operation of Bank Ochrony \u015arodowiska, the next step in \nthe implementation of the mission that has been the foundation of our \norganisation.\nThe year 2020 was unique in many ways. The COVID-19 pandemic changed \nour reality for good and has been a huge challenge, both personally for each \nof us and for the Bank as an institution. \nTogether with the entire Management Board of the Bank, I am proud that \nwe coped well in this difficult time, while supporting our clients by offering \nproducts and solutions that help them function \nduring pandemic constraints, especially those \ndirectly related to our Bank\u2019s mission: supporting \nthe green transformation of the Polish economy . This \nproves that we are able to operate effectively, efficiently \nand flexibly, even in extraordinary circumstances we do not \nto lose sight of what is most important for us - the good of our \nclients - people and companies that have trusted BO\u015a. At the same time,  \nin everything we did, we had in mind the Bank\u2019s core values: professionalism, \ncooperation, commitment, as well as respect for others and the environment.  \nOur Bank has been supporting environmentally friendly projects since it has \nbeen established. This is the idea behind the foundation of BO\u015a, contained \nin its name and defining the main mission. Hence, implementing the ESG \nStrategy, earning an ESG rating and non-financial reporting are natural course \nof development for BO\u015a. Moreover, at the dawn of the green transformation, \nas a specialist bank we are pursuing our ambition, to be a role model for the \nwider market in this area, shaping standards and good practice. We are also \nkeen for this to be clearly reflected in the product offering of BO\u015a. \nThe share of pro-environmental loans in the portfolio of Bank Ochrony \n\u015arodowiska was over 36% at the end of 2020. In this respect we are far ahead \nof all other banks in Poland and we are working hard to ensure that this \nproportion is constantly increased. For years we have not financed projects \nthat have a negative impact on the environment.\nLetter from the President\n3\nESG Report  \nBank Ochrony \u015arodowiska S.A. for 2020\n\nLast year, we concluded nearly 4,000 pro-ecological tran", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

In his impressive lecture, he demonstrated with great\nexpertise and fervour how little time we have left to limit climate change to a manageable level. As dramatic as the\nchallenges ahead of us may be, however, the outlook for the future remains optimistic: We are still in a position to\nachieve a radical reduction in greenhouse gas emissions within this decade.

Global warming and loss of biodiversity\nare without a doubt the two greatest ecological problems of our time \u2013 and they both have a direct impact on our\nnutritional security, which means we cannot a\ufb00ord to put them o\ufb00. We consider it our responsibility as a company to\ndo our part in helping to alleviate these problems. REWE is therefore going to support the new NABU climate fund of\nour long-standing partner NABU with at least 25 million euros over the next \ufb01ve years. Together we are launching the\nlargest moorland restoration project for agricultural use in Germany, and we believe that strengthening and creating\nnatural carbon sinks has huge potential to e\ufb00ectively protect the climate.\nAnother major milestone on our journey: The REWE Group intends to purchase green electricity from a new o\ufb00shore\nwind farm in the North Sea from 2025 onwards. Energy supply plays a strategic role in the context of our climate\ngoals: We are a green power pioneer in the German food retail sector. Our stores have been completely using power\nproduced from renewable sources since 2008. By signing a corporate power purchase agreement (CPPA) for the new\nBorkum Ri\ufb00grund 3 wind farm, we are now the \ufb01rst food retailer to go one step further: We are directly promoting the\nexpansion of renewable energies and taking on process responsibility as well as a more active role within the energy\ntransition.\nMoreover, we want to make it easier for our customers to opt for electric mobility by massively expanding the electric\ncharging station infrastructure \u2013 because we will only succeed in stopping climate change if we as a society\nundertake maximum e\ufb00orts in all areas of life. That is why we are increasingly relying on state-of-the-art fast-charging\nstations that allow our customers to conveniently charge their electric vehicles while they shop. This, I am sure, is just\nwhat is needed to further accelerate the spread of electric vehicles. Our goal is to establish one of the largest and\nmost modern fast-charging networks in Germany \u2013 with at least 2,000 fast-charging stations and 4,000 additional\ncharging stations at selected REWE and PENNY stores throughout Germany by the end of 2024.\nDear readers, these are just a few examples to show you that we are continuing to take responsibility and use our own\ninnovative strength to actively tackle challenges and develop solutions. Some 15 years have passed since we decided,\nout of conviction, to pursue the goal of becoming an ever more sustainable company. This is how we know that doing\nbusiness \u2013 and living \u2013 in a more sustainable way is an ongoing process. And the last two years in particular have\nshown us just how quickly we can be stripped of what we believed to be certainties.\nIn times like these, it is therefore more important than ever to show solidarity and hold together. On this note, I would\nlike to express my particular gratitude once again to all employees of the REWE Group in Germany and abroad, as well\nas to our independent retailers, whose extraordinary commitment has ensured that our company has come through\nthe crisis largely unscathed up to this point. And more than that: In moments of deep despair \u2013 such as the\ncatastrophic \ufb02oods in the Ahr valley in the summer of 2021 or the terrible war of aggression on Ukraine \u2013 their\nwillingness to help knows no bounds. From donating goods and money, to organising relief transports at short notice,\nto providing permanent voluntary support: The commitment of our employees makes me very proud indeed.\nAs a cooperative company that has been in business for 95 years, sustainability for us means, ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

However, some of \nthese attributes are increasingly critical in a more \nremote global workforce.\nThis was the finding from our 2021 Randstad Employer \nBrand Research \u2014 an extensive survey of sentiments \namong 190,000 respondents across 34 markets. We \nknow that remote working arrangements \u2014 broadly \nexpanded since the onset of COVID-19 \u2014 tend to result \nin greater talent loyalty. \nemployer brand research 2021, global report\n4\nOverall, workforce allegiance has also improved based \non the strong handling of the crisis by most employers, \nas the number who approve of their organization\u2019s \nactions vastly outnumber those who don\u2019t. This is good \nnews for the employer brand of many organizations. \nThroughout the pandemic, concerns about workforce \nstress and safety, layoffs and diminished job \nopportunities have persisted throughout many \norganizations.\n\n|\nexecutive summary.\nWill these forces, exacerbated by the pandemic, affect \nhow companies are perceived? How will the global crisis \nchange the way employers attract great talent? Will the \ntop motivations for switching employment change? \nQuestions such as these are increasingly critical as \ngrowing economies once again grapple with talent \nscarcity.\nSurprisingly, despite all the upheaval that COVID-19 has \nthrusted upon the global labor market, talent \npreferences remain much the same. The factor most \nappealing about an employer is its salary and benefits \noffering (cited by 62%), followed by a good work-life \nbalance (58%) and job security (56%).\nemployer brand research 2021, global report\n5\nIt\u2019s no surprise that a majority of respondents viewed a \nproper work-life balance as one of the top attributes of \nan ideal employer, with many working from home and \nunable to easily delineate working hours from home \nhours. This was one of the findings from our \nWorkmonitor research released in April. In fact, \nadditional research shows that not only are both blue \nand white collar workers in the UK and the Netherlands \nspending more time behind the desk since the start of \nthe pandemic, employers are expecting longer hours in \nsome instances. \n\n|\nexecutive summary.\nemployer brand research 2021, global report\n6\nSimilarly, due to massive layoffs since last March, a majority of survey \nrespondents consider job security to be an essential quality of an ideal \nemployer. This concern may be one reason more working-age adults are \nlogging longer work hours, according to CNBC. Furthermore, job insecurity has \nled to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, according to one study. \nAs these two issues have grown more consequential for employers, they also \npresent an opportunity to showcase effective policies that support the \nworkforce in these areas, which helps to bolster employer brands.\nAlthough working from home presents clear challenges, it remains an \nattractive employee value proposition. Nearly 2 in 5 surveyed want such \nflexibility, and the ratio was even higher among women, who during the \npandemic have shouldered a greater burden than men. Our Workmonitor \nresearch reveals that most, however, desire a hybrid schedule, with some days \nin the office and some days at home.\n\n|\nexecutive summary.\nAlthough the top three factors for attracting talent have \nremained unchanged from last year, we found regional \ndifferences in this year\u2019s data. For instance, career \nprogression is ranked even higher than an attractive \nsalary and benefits in Latin America \u2014 the only region \nfor which financial compensation is not the top \nmotivator. In the Commonwealth of Independent States \n(CIS), a company\u2019s reputation for being financially \nhealthy is nearly as important as offering attractive pay. \nAnd in Europe, a pleasant working environment is the \nsecond-most important benefit, after salary.\nemployer brand research 2021, global report\n7\nThe pandemic injected a lot of uncertainties into the \nworld of work, but one thing that became clearer is the \nacceleration of digitalization. As organizations, talent \nand consumers fully embraced innovative ways of \nworking and living, demand for tools and apps \nskyrocketed. This, in turn, helped the IT and \ncommunications (ITC) industry retain its position as the \nmost attractive sector globally \u2014 cited by 57% of survey \nrespondents.

In 2022, we have invested signi\ufb01cantly in our sustainability work: We have conducted a materiality \nassessment, developed a sustainability strategy, conducted a climate risk assessment, and complied with the \nexpectations and regulation in the Transparency Act, and Equality and Anti-Discrimination Act.  \nThrough transparency and dialogue with all of our stakeholders, including our workforce, our customers, partners, \nand investors, we are building trust. With our \ufb01rst ESG report, we push on that dialogue by providing more insight \ninto the steps we have taken this past year to integrate sustainability and ESG into our culture and corporate \nstrategy. Our goal is that assessments, targets, and measures related to ESG become integrated parts of goal \nmanagements, risk assessment, and the way we do business. \nWe Care \nElectri\ufb01cation is the single most important measure to limit man-made climate change. Many sectors have to \nchange their energy use, and we are working on what we believe is one of the most important. Electri\ufb01cation \ngives us the opportunity to reduce this \ufb01gure to zero.  \nYes, we are a company that operates in a market economy and works to make money. But we also care about \nthe consequences of what we do every day when we go to work. We care about making a di\ufb00erence and contri- \nbuting to a better quality of life, not just for our customers and employees, but for everyone. If we succeed in our \nmission towards zero emissions transport, then we are making the world a better place. \nWe Dare \nIn order to create the rapid changes needed to reach the climate goals, we must all dare to move outside our \ncomfort zones. We need to challenge our perceptions in the hiring process in order to create a brilliant, diverse \nwork force that can solve any task an analyze a problem from all perspectives. At Recharge, we work to up-\nhold diversity and non-discriminatory principles across our organization with regards to gender, nationality, age,  \nethnicity, religion, physical disabilities, sexual orientation, and gender identity. We have a goal of a 40 percent \ngender balance by 2025, a goal we are on our way to achieving.  \nWe must break new ground and innovate to create solutions that make it easier for people to make the choices \nthat are best for the climate and the environment. Recharge therefore aims to stay at the forefront of the devel-\nopment of our industry to help make electric vehicles (EVs) the obviously best choice for people who must have \na car. That is why we were the \ufb01rst in Norway with high power charging stations, we were the \ufb01rst to open our \ncharging network to other operators, we were the \ufb01rst with rapid charging corridors between the Nordic capitals, \nand the \ufb01rst with modular load balancing at our high power chargers. We have made improvements to how we \nensure the universal design of our charging stations, ensuring wheelchair accessibility and other adjustments to \nmake the chargers easy to use also for disabled people.  \nDaring to go \ufb01rst is demanding, but it is also enormously rewarding for us to see that we are creating the solutions \nthat enable the development towards emissions-free transport to proceed even faster.   \nWe Share \nNorway is the world\u2019s leading EV nation. Here, everyone can see that EVs in most cases work better than fossil- \nfueled cars, and it is no longer necessary to convince people that EVs are a good choice. Other countries are \nfollowing this trend, and in order to make the changes even faster outside Norway\u2019s borders, we share as much \ninformation as we can about what has made the Norwegian EV adventure possible. With over ten years\u2019 expe-\nrience as a charging operator, we have been part of the development of modern EVs from ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Within the strategic plan of KPN they have included that they keep \nthe focus on innovation through KPN ventures and the Liaison Management Team (LMT). Through \npartnerships with disruptive start-ups and scale-ups, KPN can stay ahead of the competition and \ncontinue to make an impact in a changing society. This report will shed insight how KPN and the LMT \nis functioning as a business, analyses what the biggest bottlenecks are regarding innovation, proposes \nand argues those solutions and gives some recommendations. \nAs an intern within the LMT, I am responsible for identifying opportunities to innovate, suggesting \nstart-ups that could help with this, following up on the follow-up steps and ensuring that all involved \nstay up-to-date. To this end, the various departments, here referred to as hunting grounds (HGs), are \ndivided among the various working interns within the LMT. Through collaboration with the business \nowner (BO), the person responsible for innovation within the HG, we arrive at possible connection \npoints for the LMT during discussions. It is important for the survival of this team that the LMT \ncontinues to make an impact in the form of new innovations through collaborations with start-ups. \nRecently, the number of interns working has become somewhat fewer resulting in less impact being \nmade. This report examines where the most gains can be made now that will allow the LMT to make \neven more impact.  \nFirst of all, the problem was further explained by means of the five whys method. This led to \nhypotheses that were tested by means of a questionnaire to the BO\u2019s we spoke to. In addition, a \npreviously used questionnaire from last year was also used. Based on the results of both surveys, the \nproblems were identified. From this, the following problems emerged that the LMT could benefit for \nwhen solved: First of all, the LMT needs to be seen more as a (real) part of KPN. Due to the image of \nthe interns and not always providing the right connecting parties, not everyone takes the LMT \nseriously enough. This is also evident in that BO\u2019s see the LMT primarily as fun inspiration and a way \nto have more time for other tasks. In the recommendation section some ideas and solutions are \nproposed that will result in a more professional team like consisting of more permanent employees. \nSecondly, the LMT needs to make sure that they know more about what is going on with the HG and \nBO and vice versa that the BO also knows how things are going at the LMT. For an intern it takes lots \nof time to get a feeling of how the business is really run. By having a list with all the platforms and \nproducts that are in place with additional information would definitely help the LMT in finding \nopportunities. Transparency is also an important part of innovation and is extensively explained. \n \n \n\n \nIII \n \nContents \n1 \nManagement Summary ..................................................................................................................

It recorded a total of 1,078 new \norders (820 net orders) across all programmes and market segments, including several high-profile \ncommitments from some of the world\u2019s leading carriers. The A220 won 127 firm gross new orders. \nThe A320neo Family won 888 gross new orders. In the widebody segment, Airbus won 63 gross \nnew orders including 19 A330s and 44 A350s of which 24 were for the newly launched A350F. \n \n\u0000 \nAirbus\u2019 first A321XLR (Xtra Long Range) successfully accomplished its first flight in Hamburg. \nDuring the flight, the crew tested the aircraft\u2019s flight controls, engines and main systems, including \nflight envelope protections, both at high and low speed.

These activities \nensure that saying \u201ctomorrow will be better\u201d doesn\u2019t remain a beautiful \nintent, an inflated slogan, or greenwashing.\nFor us, sustainability means producing steel, rethinking industrial \nprocesses according to more virtuous models, and investing to make them \nhappen.\nIt means working first-hand, above all as a company, to reverse a course \nthat, as it stands, has shown all its inconsistencies, fragility, and risks. \nSustainability is taking action in an increasingly profitable synergy with \nall stakeholders because sharing projects is the key to building the future \ntogether.\nYet it also means balancing the delicate nature of man versus nature in a \nzero-sum game. It enhances our know-how, letting those who look \nsuspiciously at the iron and steel world know the excellent circularity of the \nvalue underlying it. \nIt signifies promoting culture and a more respectful, inclusive, participatory \nmentality which can increase the sense of belonging to the cause of \nsustainability. Hence, without exception, we all feel called to act in favour \nof the environment. A duty that I feel above all towards the youngest.\nIn 2021, a year marked by the pandemic \nemergency, we have given concreteness to these \nobjectives with various plans and investments, \nsuch as intensifying train transport between all \ngroup factories and managing over 1.1 million \ntons of steel by rail. Another sign of \nmodernization has been the renovation of the \nentire production plant at our Swiss \nheadquarters, which will allow us to increase \nproductivity, significantly improve energy \nefficiency and reduce emissions with the \ninstallation of a new oven in the rolling mill. \nWe\u2019ve also installed new low-emission billet \nheating furnaces in the French and Romanian \nfactories. Additional activities include the \nmapping of the total CO2 contribution of our \nproduction sites and subsequent identification \nof corrective solutions, the optimiza", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}
{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": " \n \nReport of the FPSE Pension Advisory Committee \nSRI Sub-Committee: A Review of The College Pension Plan\u2019s Socially \nResponsible Investment (SRI) Practices \nFebruary 21, 2020 \n \n\u201cWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales \nof eternal economic growth.\u201d \n \n \n \nGreta Thurnberg, 2019 \nExecutive Summary  \nUnder FPSE\u2019s policy 5.12.2, the PAC SRI sub-committee has the responsibility of producing a \nreport reviewing the College Pension Plan\u2019s socially responsible investing practices every three \nyear.  The first report was submitted to Presidents\u2019 Council in 2016. This is an executive summary \nof the second edition of the report.  The 2016 SRI report very specifically addressed the questions \nlaid out in the 2014 mandate of the sub-committee.  This second report has gone into much further \ndepth on how SRI is carried out in practice, its current state, and how it is being quantified.  This \nwas a challenging undertaking for a lay committee and was only possible due to the experience of \nlong time PAC members \n \nThe principle of divestment was already covered in the 2016 report.  However, divestment has \ngained traction over the last few years with over a thousand global institutions investors having \ncommitted trillions of dollars to divestment.  Some significant and symbolic institutions joined the \ntrend in 2019, such as the Bank of Sweden or the EU\u2019s investment bank.  BCI hasn\u2019t joined this \nmovement and prefers engaging companies through participation and ownership.  There are also \nconcerns regarding the fiduciary responsibility in the sense that choosing to divest from some \ncompanies could decrease the returns of the plan. \n \nThe report also re-examines the language of SRI and RI (responsible investment) and how it \ndiffers from ESG (short for Environmental, Social and Governance).  ESG is less value-based and \nmore applied (and limited in scope) than RI and especially SRI.  The discussion on the differences \nis important because language can be used to obfuscate, mislead, or confuse people.  SRI is a \nmuch stronger statement than RI and shifts the goal posts.  Leaving out the \u2018social\u2019 aspect for \ninstance, means potentially ignoring issues regarding human rights or labour standards. I t is \nrecommended that BCI develop a relevant values framework that demonstrates leadership.  \n \nRegarding current BCI\u2019s practices, the report recognizes that BCI has presented a strategy but also \nfinds it somewhat lacking compared to other plans around the world.  Some of the limitations \nPage 58 of 91 \nPC | Oct 15-16, 2020\n\ninclude a relatively short timeframe used for the analysis (15 years) as well as a lack of hard \ntargets regarding decreasing the carbon footprint of the plan. The following is thus recommended: \n \n\uf0b7 That BCI take a more active, leadership role in addressing climate change \n\uf0b7 That BCI set specific targets for reducing its carbon footprint \n\uf0b7 That BCI extend its forecast horizon in order to better capture the potential risk of its \ninvestments to the environment. \n\uf0b7 That BCI, as a matter of intergenerational justice, factor into its risk assessments risks to \nthe maintenance of just institutions and access to a reasonable quality of life that will be \nborne by future pensioners. \n \nOne of the powerful ways to influence BCI\u2019s practices is through the SIPP (Statement of \nInvestment Policies and Procedures).  It is recommended that College Pension Plan trustees \nreview this SIPP.  Our trustees already have this on their agenda for the March 2020 meeting and \nare working with the Inter-plan Investment Committee to coordinate with the plan partners. \n \nBCI believes ESG engagement is the appropriate mechanism for addressing concerns with \ncompanies.  Priorities are decided based on the materiality of the risk, the ability to influence as \nwell as research and data. BCI uses KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to assess ESG risks.  \nThose KPIs include, among others, climate change disclosure of companies, gender diversity or \nexecutives\u2019 compensation in Canada.  While encouraging and promising, it is noted that the use of \nKPI\u2019s is still relatively new and thus our ability to measure progress on ESG is limited.  Moreover, \nwith the increasing importance of private equities investments, improved reporting in this area is \ndesirable as well as the application of the KPIs.  The report recommends the following:  \n \n\uf0b7 BCI should publish the detailed list of the 40 KPI currently being used and provide an \naggregate rating on how well each one is being met. \n\uf0b7 BCI needs to publish aggregate data on the number of companies engaged, the level of \nengagement, and the effectiveness of the effort. \n\uf0b7 The ESG report is focused on public equities.  Private equity investments are now at 8.5% \nof managed assets and the intention is to continue growing this area.  BCI needs to develop \na mechanism for reporting on the ESG performance in this area. \n\uf0b7 BCI should report on how ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Fixler, a former \nsustainability manager at DWS, revealed that the asset \nmanagement firm was promoting its investment fund \nproducts as greener than they actually were. Since then, US \nand German regulators have been investigating DWS and  \nits parent company Deutsche Bank for suspected investment \nfraud stemming from greenwashing \u2013 a first in the sector. \nMeanwhile, in several studies of the Deutsche Bank subsidi-\nary, Greenpeace has managed to identify additional instances \nof greenwashing. All of this suggests that the fraud with \nsustainability promises at DWS might be systematic.\nIn light of these revelations, the present report examines the \nrole played by the DWS senior executive remuneration \nsystem in the greenwashing scandal and its ongoing impact \ntoday. It is based on publicly available data such as annual \nand remuneration reports. This analysis focuses on three \nrecognized principles of sustainability that must be fulfilled \nto pave the way for effective operational implementation of a \ncompany-wide sustainability strategy \u2013 principles which \nDWS itself was involved in developing:\n\u2014\t Company remuneration structures must adhere to  \n\t\nthe principle of proportionality. \n\u2014\t The achievement of sustainability targets must have a  \n\t\nsizeable impact on executive remuneration. \n\u2014\t The relevance and materiality of the sustainability  \n\t\ntargets must be assured.\nThe research conducted by Greenpeace has led to the  \nfollowing findings on the DWS remuneration system: \n\t A review of the proportionality of the DWS remuneration \nsystem has revealed that, given the size of the compa-\nny, the DWS CEO is by far Germany\u2019s best-paid manag-\ner of a listed company. A peer group comparison shows \nthat the salary of the DWS CEO is significantly higher \nthan what is paid for similar positions in the industry, \nand even exceeds the salary of most CEOs of DAX-list-\ned companies. Hence, the company fails to take an \nappropriate approach to top executive salaries as a \nkey means of achieving sustainability goals.\n\t When it comes to weighting sustainability targets in \nexecutive board remuneration, there is ample evidence \nthat environmental, social and governance (ESG) \ncriteria have had a substantial influence on the salaries \nreceived by top management and by the CEO in \nparticular since 2020. The structuring of bonus-relat-\ned sustainability targets has proven to be highly \nproblematic, though, because it gives top manage-\nment massive incentives to pursue systematic \ngreenwashing. The relabeling of funds to meet 2020 \nsustainability goals can be considered as manipula-\ntion. This questionable approach enabled former CEO \nAsoka W\u00f6hrmann to receive higher bonuses.\n\t By all appearance, this massive perverse incentive has \nnow been recognized. In the Compensation Report \n2021, the problematic goal of \u201cESG-specific assets \nunder management\u201d has been removed from the \nperformance targets for the C", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

In \nthe Supervisory Board, we looked at the importance of ESG for Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group as a whole, the \nbusiness opportunities it presents and the progress made in each respective area. ESG is also a core \ncomponent of the remuneration system for the Executive Board, which was revised in 2021.

Accordingly, we have made progress \nin placing our products and services within reach \nof individuals, thereby boosting their quality of \nlife. For example, RedSalud has implemented new \ntelemedicine alternatives like online testing, while \nVida C\u00e1mara launched \u201c5-50,\u201d a product aimed at \nSMEs with five to 50 employees who previously \ncould not access supplemental health insurance. \nOne of the key challenges we have set for ourselves \nis to get to know our customers better so that, in \nturn, we are able to better serve their needs.  In this \nspirit, Confuturo has enabled online tools such as \nthe Online Advisor, a virtual guide available to assist \nusers with their pensions and life annuities. \nBut we believe that we must take this further\u2014beyond \nour customers\u2014which is why we have revamped \nour programs to have an impact on the community \nas a whole. RedSalud spearheaded a series of \nregional initiatives, by providing access to testing \nand preventative screenings in several communities. \nConsalud continues to host family sporting events \nsuch as the Recreational Bike Path in Santiago and \nthe Vi\u00f1a del Mar Marathon. Moreover, our subsidiaries \nhave partnered with various organizations, such as \nLas Rosas Foundation, Esperanza Shelter, Sofofa\u2019s \nNetwork of Inclusive Companies (REIN), and \nothers, to manage donations to vulnerable groups. \nLikewise, we must not forget that proceeds from our \noperations are allocated to funding social projects \nin the construction industry. In 2019, our majority \nshareholder, Chilean Chamber of Construction, invested \nUS$19 million in projects benefiting construction \nworkers and their families. Most of these projects \nwere financed through ILC dividends.  \nOur second strategic pillar is centered on fostering a \nculture of service and ethics among all team members. \nIn order for our employees to provide good services, \nthey must be motivated and trained; we also make \nan effort to instill our dedication to inclusiveness \nthroughout the entire organization. One example is \nour commitment to promoting female employees: \nwomen account for 73% of our total workforce and \n65% of new hires, not to mention that for the first \ntime ever a woman sits on our Board of Directors.  \nIn addition, we have reinforced ethical aspects of \nour operations. In 2019, ILC adjusted and certified \nits Crime Prevention Model to broaden the scope \nto include new crimes that could have an impact \non the Company (Law 21,121). Our subsidiaries, in \nthe meantime, are undertaking similar processes to \nupdate their models as well.  We have also focused \non reinforcing our culture of ethics, especially as \nfar as commercial processes are concerned, so \nthat we will always operate with the best interests \nof our customers in mind. As such, RedSalud has \nenabled L\u00ednea \u00c9tica, a specialized platform for receiving \ncomplaints and claims related to re", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The independent auditor\u2019s report can be found on page 133 et seq. of this \nAnnual Report.  \nNotes on Reporting  \nFramework \nThis statement was prepared in accordance with sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e of \nthe German Commercial Code (\u201cHGB\u201d). International frameworks such as the GRI and Greenhouse Gas \nProtocol (GHG) Protocol were used to prepare the indicators.  \nMaterial Topics Subject to Reporting Requirements \nThe topics subject to reporting requirements are derived directly from the strategic sustainability topics \ndefined in fiscal 2022, which are described in the Sustainability Management section.  \nConsolidation \nThe concepts requiring presentation under Section 289c(3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) for the \nmain sustainability issues, including due diligence processes and the results of the concepts, relate to the \nentire Group in accordance with the scope of consolidation for financial reporting (see page 184 et seq. of this \nAnnual Report), unless otherwise stated at the respective point.  \nFurther Information  \nThe key performance indicators provided in this statement serve to quantify the Group\u2019s performance and do \nnot constitute performance indicators relevant to company management within the meaning of Section \n289c(3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB).  \nThe presentation of indicators in this statement has been largely restructured and expanded compared with \nthe previous year.

This will be published in the first quarter of \n2023 for fiscal 2022.  \nSustainability Management  \nBusiness Model \nSartorius operates in the life science sector \u2013 more precisely, in the field of medical biotechnology. As a partner \nto the biopharmaceutical industry, the Group manufactures products and process technologies that are used \nin the development and production of biological medicines and vaccines. In this context, the Group places a \nparticular focus on innovations that make it possible to increase the safety, speed, and efficiency of the \ndevelopment and production process for such active ingredients. This allows new therapies to be made \navailable to patients earlier, at lower prices, and to a larger number of patients.  \nFor further information on the Group\u2019s business model, strategy, and objectives, please refer to the section \n\u201cBusiness Model, Strategy, and Goals\u201d on page 26 et seq. of this Annual Report.  \nAmbition and Strategic Sustainability Topics \nAs a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, the Group is committed to complying with certain social \nand environmental standards when conducting its business activities. This includes identifying and preventing, \nor mitigating, adverse impacts on the environment and society that may arise throughout the upstream and \ndownstream value chain as a result of business operations and provide remediation.  \nSartorius maintains a close, ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders in this regard. We define stakeholders as \nthose individuals, companies, institutions, and interest groups that are able to influence the success of the \nSartorius Group or are affected by the company\u2019s activities. This particularly includes customers, employees, \ninvestors, suppliers, and business partners as well as local residents.

With our technologies, we \nhelp researchers and engineers achieve faster, easier progress in the life sciences and bioprocess technology, \nthus enabling the development of new and better treatments and vaccines and affordable medical care. \nMany people in industrialized countries suffer from diseases for which there is as yet no effective treatment. \nThese include cancer, dementia and autoimmune diseases as well as congenital metabolic disorders and \ninfectious diseases. At the same time, many diseases that would have proved fatal just a few generations ago \ncan now be cured or treated effectively. Combined with declining birth rates, this has led to an aging society \nin industrialized countries where people are expected to remain fit and healthy for as long as possible. \nIn developing and emerging countries, the availability and affordability of healthcare is well below the \nstandards in industrialized nations: more than half the world\u2019s population has either no or inadequate access \nto medical care. For every second child, initial immunization is an unachievable goal, and it is estimated that \n1.5million children under the age of five die from diseases from which they could be protected with \nvaccinations. \nThe purpose of our business is to help our customers develop and manufacture biotechnology-based drugs \nand vaccines and, in doing so, enable the development and safe production of vaccines and \nbiopharmaceutical medicines to treat serious and, in some cases, rare diseases. The United Nations\u2019 \nsustainability goal \u2018Good Health and Well-Being\u2019 is thus an integral part of our core business. \nAs a 150-year old company, sustainability is firmly embedded at many levels in our business. To us, it means \noperating responsibly over the long term \u2013 with respect to customers, employees, investors, business partners \nand society as a whole. Likewise, it entails handling natural resources responsibly. Sustainable action also \nmeans remaining agile and constantly asking ourselves how we can respond to the changing world and make \na positive contribution. This concerns the continued development of our core business just as much as living \nup to our corporate responsibilities. \nBecause of the Covid-19 pandemic, 2020 was characterized by changes that posed serious challenges for \nsociety as a whole. At the same time, the crisis showed how Sartorius\u2019 core business makes a direct contribution \ntowards the goal of \u201chealthy lives and well-being for all at all ages\u201d: with its products and process knowledge, \nSartorius is involved in many of the worldwide vaccine projects to combat the coronavirus. \nOptimization of processes and methods throughout the entire supply chain can also make a contribution \ntowards sustainability \u2013 this mainly includes the consideration of sustainability in procurement, product \ndevelopment and production. Our product portfolio includes consumables such as filters, pipette tips, cell \nculture media and bags. These sterile products for use in biopharmaceutical research and development have \nsignificant benefits compared to reusable products. Nevertheless, we see potential to reduce our use of \nnatural resources in this area. \nIn this connection, Sartorius signed the European Plastics Pact in 2020 as the first company in its industry. The \naim of this public-private initiative is to improve the use and recycling of plastics and, as a consequence, use \nless virgin plastic. With cross-border cooperation agreements on a European level, the signatories want  \nto develop new technologies, share their findings, harmonize guidelines and standards and dismantle  \nexisting barriers. \n\nSartorius\nCombined Group Management Report\nResponsibility at Sartorius\n123\nStart\nSartorius\u2019 CO2 emissions are relatively low, since the company is not a high energy user nor does it purchase \nenergy-intensive raw materials. However, we do believe it is important that we play our part in helping to \nreduce global warming. To reduce our Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions, we set ourselves science-based targets \nin the reporting year, which are based on the science-based targets and the 1.5\u00b0C goal. \nThis year, our Corpo", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}}}}

We \nare now signatories of several important initiatives \nin the financial industry, such as the PRI (since \n2008), Paris Aligned Investment Initiative Private \nEquity Working Group (2021), ILPA ESG Data \nConvergence Initiative (2021) and are part of SEB \nInvestment Management\u2019s commitment to net-zero \nemissions across our portfolios by 2040. I also feel \ngood about the resources we have dedicated to \nsustainability \u2013 a crucial part of an ambitious \napproach to sustainability. Not only do we have a \nteam within the investment team that takes \nleadership on sustainability issues, but we also have \nextensive resources to draw on through our close \ncollaboration with the rest of SEB and can access \ndeep ESG expertise to the benefit of our investors \nand portfolio companies.\nI\u2019m also happy with the impressive work of our \nportfolio companies. In 2022, we had our first \nportfolio company, Accedo, submit a Science-Based \nTarget. Accedo has taken a very proactive \napproach to sustainability and aims to be a leader in \nsustainability in the media-tech industry, as they see \nthe benefits it has on recruiting and employee \nretention, customer dialogues, and reputation \namong stakeholders. We have also seen several \nother portfolio companies take steps to improve \ntheir governance around sustainability, improve \ntheir data tracking, and set goals and targets for \ntheir sustainability work.\nSFDR level 2 came into force in yearend 2022. \nDuring the spring, we have done an extensive job of \ngathering data on our portfolio companies to assess \ntheir performance on key sustainability metrics. \nThis exercise was carried out a year ago for our \nNordic portfolio, and in this, we have found a good \nworking model for supporting our businesses in \nbetter understanding their environmental and social \nfootprints.\nWhile it is easy to find parts of the SFDR and \nTaxonomy to criticise, we believe the new \nregulation will play an important role in driving \nwider adoption in the financial industry to take \nconcrete steps in the right direction. This is just the \nbeginning of a long journey and I\u2019m optimistic that \nthe early uncertainty and misalignment between \nthe regulation and what really is material to \nbusinesses will converge over time.\nVictor Lang\nCIO and Head of SEB Private Equity\nOpening remarks\nOur commitment to sustainability is \nstronger than ever, and we have taken \nseveral important steps during 2022 \nto raise the bar on sustainability.\n3\n1.

We focus on developing \ncompanies both operationally and \nstrategically by partnering with \nentrepreneurs and managers. By doing so, \nwe have managed to build a highly \nexperienced team with an excellent \nnetwork, and the skills to source \nproprietary investment opportunities and \ncreate long-term investor value.\nWe manage approximately USD 4bn in \ncapital on behalf of clients, and our \nStockholm-based team makes \ninvestments both across the Nordics and \nglobally. Our approach is unique. It is \ndifferent from other private equity firms in \nthat we invest directly in majority-owned \ncompanies in the Nordics, directly \nalongside selected partners globally and \nindirectly through established \npartnerships as primaries and \nsecondaries. This investment strategy \nallows us to be flexible and opportunistic \nduring market movements to direct our \nattention to where it is most lucrative to \ninvest.\n1998\nSEB PE was founded\n100+\nDirect investments\n9\nFunds raised\n17\nInvestment professionals\n2008\nBecame a \nsignatory of the UN PRI\n$4bn\nAuM\n1\nDedicated \nsustainability specialist\n7 of 9\nFunds classified \nas article 8 or 9\n>2.5x\nGross MOIC across all \nexited direct investments\nAt a glance:\n4\n2.

We recognise the role we play in contributing to a sustainable future. The Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC) warns that, should global warming reach 1.5\u00b0C in the foreseeable future, it will cause increasing climate \nhazards and present unavoidable risks to all ecosystems and humans.\nAs we said in our Annual Report, we are proud of the progress we have made in our global Environmental, Social and Gover-\nnance (ESG) programme over the last year. It continues to drive positive impacts within SoftwareOne and the communities in \nwhich we operate. We are fully committed to reducing our carbon footprint, conserving resources, and promoting sustainable \npractices throughout our operations.\nWe have identified a set of material risks and areas for improvement across all areas of ESG, which require collaboration from \nacross the many departments in SoftwareOne. We will continue to drive more sustainable outcomes for our clients via techno-\nlogy solutions, while further embedding sustainability in our own operations and across our value chain.\nPeople-centric approach\nSince its launch in 2021, our ESG programme has received unwavering support from our Board of Directors which created a \nnew ad hoc ESG Committee chaired by Isabelle Romy.\nTo strengthen our ESG framework in 2022, employee-driven committees were created under the three ESG topics. These \ncommittees are each chaired by members of the Executive Board; Bernd Schlotter, President of Services, Julia Braun, Chief \nHuman Resources Officer and Frank Rossini, Chief Legal Officer.\nInnovative strategy\nSoftwareOne has a unique opportunity to leverage our core expertise and market-leading technologies in our approach to our \nESG strategy. In 2022, SoftwareOne made significant headway in calculating our carbon footprint to use as a baseline for our \nstrategies on emission reduction and avoidance. We obtained internal support to create a global Diversity Equity Inclusion and \nBelonging  strategy and moved forward in incorporating ESG into our third-party risk management strategies.\nPartnering for the Future\nAddressing ESG challenges requires long-term collaboration and continuous innovation. Effective actions that limit global \nwarming could substantially reduce projected losses and damages in human systems and ecosystems, which is why our call to \naction goes beyond compliance with regulations. It is about embracing a mindset of innovation and collaboration. In this report, \nwe have set ambitious targets to further reduce our environmental impact, enhance social inclusivity and diversity, and streng-\nthen our overall governance practices. We recognise that it is only though our client partnerships, employee passion and total \nbuy in that together we can make an impact that will benefit our planet and our people.\n \nBrian Duffy, CEO\nA letter from our CEO\nBrian Duffy \nCEO\nwww.softwareone.com\n4\nSoftwareOne ESG Report 2022\nOur Purpose\n\nAbout us\nSoftwareOne is a leading global software and cloud solutions provider with over 9,000 employees.

Some of these forces might be short-lived, such as higher \nenergy prices; others, including the political polarization of ESG issues in the United States, \nare more difficult to gauge. The most powerful, disruptive force, however, is arguably Russia\u2019s \ninvasion of Ukraine, which created a pressing need to strengthen energy security and will \nlikely require more fossil fuel extraction in the medium term. \nExisting international pledges to cut \ncarbon emissions to net zero by 2050 \nwere already challenging. Governments \nand companies are now scrambling to \nbalance their green ambitions with these \nnew imperatives of energy security. The \nwar exposed all too clearly what was already known: the dependency that many countries, \nparticularly in Europe, have on Russia\u2019s oil and gas exports. \nOther stress points have emerged among those that in the past were leading champions \nof ESG issues. The world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, reduced its support for U.S. \nshareholder proposals on ESG issues by nearly half in this year\u2019s annual meeting season, \nas the firm voted for just 24% of them. The group had warned in May that shareholder ESG \nproposals were becoming too prescriptive, and that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had changed \nthe investment calculus.\nESG has also become a political flashpoint in the United States, reflecting partisan \ndifferences and regional economies. While some states have issued extensive ESG mandates, \nothers have adopted measures that seek to exclude banks supporting ESG policies on issues \nincluding climate change and gun control. Social issues have also come under scrutiny, and \nmany companies are being caught in the political crossfire. In light of the U.S. Supreme Court \noverturning the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing abortion rights, some companies have \nadopted policies to help female employees to obtain abortion services, while some states \nhave targeted those companies. \nStill, amid the headwinds produced by such controversies there are notable developments. \nIf anything, the Ukraine war should quicken efforts by Western governments, particularly in \nIntroduction: A perfect storm puts ESG \nmomentum under strain\nGovernments and companies are \nnow scrambling to balance their \ngreen ambitions with these new \nimperatives of energy security.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2022\nSpecial report: ESG under strain     4\nEurope, to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels. Signs of more rapid change have already \nemerged. Germany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, agreed to a major package of reforms in \nJuly aimed at boosting the production of renewable power. The government expects to end \npurchases of Russian coal and oil this year, and of natural gas by 2024.\nIn the United States, Congress approved, and the President signed, the Inflation Reduction \nAct in August, which includes $370 billion to support clean energy sources and speed the \ntransition from fossil fuels. The new law is expected to accelerate private sector investment \nin renewable energy and will help the United States meet its net-zero emissions pledge \nby 2050.\nMeanwhile, ESG regulatory efforts in the EU, the UK, and the Asia-Pacific region are \ngathering pace, with numerous proposals on company climate disclosures either already in \neffect or poised to come into force this year or next. \nHow these crosscurrents play out over the next year is difficult to predict. This report will \nfocus on two problems that affect all companies and should be on the agenda of boards and \nsenior management: the growing efforts of regulators to stamp out \u201cgreenwashing\u201d and the \nuneven pace of ESG regulation among jurisdictions. \nThe importance of the underlying principles of ESG has not diminished; indeed, the \nimperative for companies to earn their social license appears to be rising. \n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2022\nSpecial report: ESG under strain     5\nWith stakeholders, including consumers and investors, pressuring companies to demonstrate \ntheir ESG credentials, the risks of so-called greenwashing have grown.

We understand how important it \nis to balance environmental initiatives with business activities, and strive to \nreduce emissions through new technology development, renewable energy \nuse and other measures.\nGRI103-1  GRI103-2\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nNISSAN MOTOR CORPORATION\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020\nEnvironmental\nCEO Message\nSocial\nCSO Message\nGovernance\nCorporate Purpose /\nESG Highlights\nESG Data\nSustainability at Nissan\nEditorial Policy\nNissan's Contribution \nto the SDGs\nGRI Content Index\nThe Alliance\nQuick Guide For Investors\n057\nContents\nEnvironmental\nEfforts at Every Link in the Value Chain\nThe Nissan Green Program 2022 (NGP2022) aims to achieve carbon \nneutrality by reducing emissions from our corporate activities, products and \nservices.\nCO2 Emissions in the Value Chain*\nSuppliers\n19.520\nmillion tons\nReducing CO2 emissions from corporate activities\nProduction\n2.610\nmillion tons\nLogistics\n1.483\nmillion tons\nVehicle usage\n180.880\nmillion tons\nOf\ufb01ces,\ndealerships\n0.619\nmillion tons\nRecycling\nReducing CO2 emissions from products and service\n* Actual emissions in 2018.\nBuilding a Resilient Climate Change Strategy\nThe incremental move toward decarbonization could generate major new \nrisks for businesses. In addition to transition risks resulting from changes in \npolicies and regulations, technologies, markets and reputation, there are also \ngrowing physical risks, as climate change raises the frequency of extreme \nweather conditions. Recognizing climate change as a risk for the financial \nsystem, the G20 Financial Stability Board established the Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to encourage disclosures \nthat would enable investors to make informed decisions. In its June 2017 \nfinal report, the Task Force proposed a recommendations framework for \ninformation disclosure.\nNissan considers climate change to be an issue that goes to the heart of its \noperations. The Global Environmental Management Committee (G-EMC), \nco-chaired by a board member, identifies trends in climate-related risks and \nbusiness opportunities and adopts strategies accordingly. Climate change \nand other environmental risks comprise a category of risks for corporate \nmanagement and are regularly monitored by the Internal Control Committee \nto strengthen corporate governance.\nWe analyze climate-related risks on an ongoing basis, and have specified \nas major risks tighter regulations on fuel economy and CO2 emissions, \nintensifying competition in the EV market and physical damage due to \nextreme weather conditions. We determine specific measures to be taken \nby each division after clarifying the risks and opportunities\u0336including those \nrelating to climate change\u0336for our company.\nAdditionally, climate change also greatly heightens customer needs for \nenergy-efficient mobility.

With the pandemic persisting in shaping our new \nnormal, unstable widespread macro-economic trends and challenging times in the luxury market, \nat Sergio Rossi we faced these unexpected circumstances with great e\ufb00orts and remained true to \nour DNA with a further step in innovation investments. Moreover, as the CEO, I am pleased to see \nhow uni\ufb01ed our Group has been throughout the past two years. \nOur focus was placed not only in shaping original and unique high-fashion footwears for our \ncustomers, but also on ensuring that our employees' needs were looked after. As a cohesive \nGroup, we successfully overcame the di\ufb03culties guided by our long-term commitment towards \nsustainability, that foresees a great attention to the environment we live in, the people involved in \nour activities and the local communities around us.\nAs anticipated last year, as of 2021, we are glad to be a part of the Lanvin Group (formerly Fosun \nFashion Group) and this exciting new partnership with an international luxury fashion group is \nset to increase our brand's global reputation and to present us with interesting new opportunities. \nMoreover, since the Lanvin Group is headquartered in China, we will be looking to expand further \nour presence in Asia, one of our most important markets. Grateful for this new journey, we look \nahead optimistically with a great enthusiasm to start new challenges. \nDespite the di\ufb03cult context, we never forwent our responsibilities towards the environment. \nWe continued purchasing certi\ufb01ed renewable energy and are proud to announce that, as of 2021, \n100% of electricity purchased for our factory and all our Italian stores comes from renewable \nsources. In addition, thanks also to our in-house photovoltaic system, we were able to avoid more \nthan 1,200 tonnes of CO2. \nAll our women and men are the core of the success of our company. Our artisans' love and dedication \nto every shoe we make highlights our passion, which has always distinguished our brand, heritage \nand know-how. We believe in our people, enhancing their technical skills and knowledge and \npromoting long lasting relationships. In fact, as of 2021, I am honoured to say that 63% of our \ntechnicians and artisans have been with us for more than 10 years. This incredible achievement, \ntogether with the introduction of a generation of new artisans, further reduction in work-related \ninjuries, underlines the way we take care of our people and the future of the company. \nLastly, another point on which we focus our attention are local communities. Since our inception, \nour beloved founder Sergio Rossi has always understood the importance of our roots and the \nartistic craftsmanship of the Italian style. The passion for our daily work encourages us to \ncelebrate the Artisanal Maestria that distinguishes our creations: as a result, we periodically \ncollect historical models, documents and drawings from all over the world to extend our Living \nHeritage Archive with the aim to promote, perpetuate and disseminate our roots. Furthermore, \nwe contribute to the prosperity and the development of our surrounding areas preferring Italian \nsuppliers (95%), the 22% of which is located in Emilia Romagna.  \nAt Sergio Rossi, we believe sustainability goes beyond our reporting commitment. In addition \nto the attention we place in annually reporting our environmental, social and economic \nperformances, we are also dedicated to adhering to two international voluntary frameworks \nsponsored by the United Nations, the Global Compact (UNGC) and the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs). On the one hand, we joined the UNGC community of 14,000 companies and 4,000 \nnon-business, becoming participant since 2017 and maintaining our responsibilities towards it to \nthis day. On the other hand, understanding the importance that Sustainable Development Goals \nplay in driving business awareness and actions, we have pledged to tackle a series of them to the \nbest of our abilities.\nIn looking at Sergio Rossi's future with excitement, we are con\ufb01dent that through boldness and \ninnovation, we will contin", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

These \nchallenges serve as a stark reminder of our call to action for \nsecuring a \u2018sustainable future.\u2019\nIn this context, we drastically strengthened our sustainability \ngovernance to highlight that \u2018sustainability\u2019 remains our top \npriority in our business operations and to embed this priority in \nevery aspect of the organization.\nIn addition to establishing the Sustainability Management \nOffice within each business unit and elevating the existing \ncompany-wide function as the Corporate Sustainability Center, \nwe expanded the Governance Committee under the Board of \nDirectors as the Sustainability Committee in 2021 to reinforce the \nBoard\u2019s oversight of sustainability activities. We also placed the \nSustainability Council, an executive-level consultative body, under \nthe direct leadership of the CEO in 2022. \nThese changes have perfected a virtuous cycle where the pursuit \nof sustainability leads to advanced products and enhanced \nbusiness competitiveness.\nOur sustainability governance serves as a momentum in \nidentifying new drivers for sustainable growth, strengthening our \nfuture competitiveness, and fulfilling our corporate responsibility.\nOur ultimate goal is to help consumers join us in our journey to \nbuild a better tomorrow through our innovations. We focus on \nstepping up our efforts to create technologies that further widen \nthe gap with our competitors while linking consumer's decision to \nchoose our products to reflect their sustainable lifestyles. \nOur eco-conscious advances, including low-power semiconductors, \nthe SmartThings Energy service designed to reduce energy \nconsumption using AI-based energy-saving features on smart \nappliances, the SolarCell Remote Control charged by sunlight or \nindoor lighting, and smartphone models made with materials \nrecycled from discarded fishing nets, are the proud results of our \ncontinued pursuit of sustainability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and intensifying international conflicts \nonce again remind us that cooperation with diverse stakeholders \nis imperative in ensuring success as a global company. We will \ncontinue to mutually grow and advance with communities we \nserve by capitalizing on our rich legacy, expertise, and wealth of \nresources.\nWe will expand our corporate citizenship activities centered on \nnurturing the technological prowess of the younger generations, \nwhile reinforcing and launching forward-looking initiatives to \nnarrow the technological gap amid the transition to a digital \nsociety, including support for SMEs through the smart factory \nsystem.

The aftermath of the \ncorona pandemic, the tense geopolitical situation as \nwell as Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting sanc\u00ad\ntions caused bottlenecks in the supply of energy and \nraw materials, significant price increases and high infla\u00ad\ntion. In this extraordinary and difficult situation, the \nSemperit Group demonstrated its robustness and agility.\nThe signing of the divestment of Sempermed to HARPS \nGLOBAL PTE LTD at the end of December 2022 was an \nimportant milestone for our company, as it enables us \nto push ahead with our orientation as an industrial \npolymer specialist in addition to implementing the \nsegment sale. As part of the ongoing transformation \nprocess, Semperit is not only striving for further organic \nand inorganic growth, but at the same time also for \nmajor steps in operational sustainability. We are aware \nthat this will not be an easy undertaking for a rubber \nprocessing company in the chemical industry. Never\u00ad\ntheless, we are convinced that we can achieve the goal, \nwith a transparent ESG portfolio that has a noticeable \npositive impact on all three areas: environmental, social \nand governance.\nIt was with pleasure and pride that we accepted the \n\u201cAustria\u2019s Leading Companies Award\u201d in the category \n\u201dSustainability\u201d in listed companies in Austria for 2022. \nThe award in the area of sustainability was well \ndeserved: we worked hard over the past five years to \nachieve this quality level in sustainability and the corre\u00ad\nsponding reporting. We consciously and purposefully \nset the bar high in our reporting quality and will \ncontinue to make this demand on ourselves in the \nfuture in the highly complex regulatory environment. \nFOREWORD FROM THE \nEXECUTIVE BOARD\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO \nANCHOR SUSTAINABILITY \nNOT ONLY IN ALL AREAS \nOF THE COMPANY, BUT \nALSO IN THE HEARTS AND \nMINDS OF OUR EMPLOYEES.\nSEMPERIT | SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2022\n4\n\nThe coming months will be no less intense than the \npast year.

In this area, Solaris, with its wide \nrange of environmentally friendly zero and low emission \nbuses, is one of the European leaders. The manufacturer  \nhas for years consistently prioritized innovation  \nand cross-sector collaboration in developing innovative \nsolutions for zero and low emission transportation, \ncombining this with a deep understanding of the needs \nof cities that are starting or are already on the road to  \na green transition in transportation.\nDespite the challenges of 2022, Solaris \u2013 in line with the \nCAF Group\u2019s vision \u2013 is undertaking further activities  \nand investments to, among other things, reduce its \ncarbon footprint within its own operations as well as \nthroughout the life cycle of the products  \nit offers. This not only contributes to reducing  \nthe organization\u2019s impact on the environment,  \nbut also helps ensure better living conditions  \nfor the residents of the cities in which Solaris  \nbuses operate.\nWhile history shows us how difficult it is to predict the \nfuture, it also teaches us that innovation along with \noperational efficiency are the key to success in any \nscenario. In this regard, Solaris, within the CAF Group, \nwill continue its decarbonization strategy, expanding its \nrange of buses powered by alternative energy sources \n(electricity and hydrogen), automation of transportation \nsystems, digitalization of processes, and cybersecurity, \namong others.\nI therefore encourage you to read the Solaris \nSustainability Report, in which you will find  \na summary of Solaris\u2019 activities over the past year in the \nfollowing areas: business focus, operational efficiency, \ninnovation and sustainability.\nJavier Martinez Ojinaga\nCEO of CAF Group, \nChairman of the Supervisory Board of Solaris Bus & Coach\nLetter from the President of the Supervisory Board\n\n2022 Solaris Sustainability Report\n4\n74\nSustainable \nproduction\nSocial \nresponsibility\nSustainable \nproduct\nAbout \nthe Report\nResponsible \ngovernance\nSolaris \nGroup\nAmong the challenges the world faces today, climate \nchange and its social impacts remain constant.  \nIn 2022, as Solaris, we continued to ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

In this \nenvironment some organisations have chosen to scale down \ntheir sustainability efforts. We, however, have done quite the \nopposite. For instance, when Covid-19 hit, we launched our \nShared Mission initiative to provide pro bono assistance to \nprojects working to reduce the negative consequences of the \npandemic; when Russia invaded Ukraine, we immediately \ndonated to Red Cross efforts in Ukraine and offered pro bono \nsupport to Ukrainians; and so on. Overall, we have accelerated \nour sustainability and ESG efforts to new levels, with the \nunderstanding that our region\u2019s long-term prosperity depends \nto a significant extent on the commitments and initiatives being \nundertaken now. \nDuring the reporting period we increased our focus on the well-\nbeing and development of Sorainen team, and on creating a \nmore diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment. As a result, \nour people displayed increased engagement and loyalty. \nWe continued to strengthen our operations by launching \nnew ESG services, investing in innovation and tech solutions, \nstreamlining and intensifying our pro bono endeavours, \nreinforcing our security and compliance systems and \nprocedures, and achieving even more alignment in everything \nwe do. All the while, we remained firmly committed to our core \npurpose: helping our clients succeed. \nI am glad to present this, our first sustainability report, \ndescribing our initial progress on a journey that is, of course, \nonly starting. I hope that this report will not only shed light on \nour sustainability and ESG initiatives, but will also encourage \nother businesses in our region to promote a sustainability \nmindset, forge partnerships, and build sustainable businesses. \nLetter to readers from our managing partner Laimonas Skibarka\nSorainen\nLaimonas Skibarka, \nManaging Partner of Sorainen\n\u201cOur region\u2019s long-term prosperity \ndepends on the commitments and \ninitiatives being undertaken now.\u201d\n\n4\nSorainen and sustainability\nIn 2021 our approach to the concept of sustainability became \nmore streamlined and strategic, and we created a dedicated \ncross-functional team to monitor and improve our efforts \nat the regional and local levels. The work of the sustainability \nteam is guided by the Steering Committee, which consists of \nthe firm\u2019s partners, senior management, and board members. \nWe continue to look for ways to expand our efforts, and at  \nthe beginning of this year we completed two major steps in \nthis regard. First, we launched a new Environment, Social \nand Governance (ESG) service line dedicated to helping \nclients navigate the constantly-changing landscape of  \nsustainability-related regulations. \nSecond, we established the position of Sustainability \nOfficer to embed sustainability and social-responsibility \nprinciples into the firm\u2019s processes, teams, and projects.

This is our first \nSustainability Report\nIt is with great pleasure that I present to you our first \nSustainability Report. I see its publication as another \nkey milestone on our new path to sustainability. \nTogether with the new owners and our employees, \nwe have laid a solid foundation for a completely new \ndirection for the GasNet Group.\nBecause a shared future is what matters to us, ESG \n(Environmental, Social, Governance) forms the very \nbasis of our new strategy. We care about how we treat \neach other, our communities and the environment. We \ncare about our health and the health of our society. \nAnd that\u2019s why the only thing that gives us purpose \nis to do business in a sustainable, responsible and \nconsiderate way. Let me tell you the story of our \nSustainability Report.\nIt is divided into four main chapters representing \nthe four pillars of our ESG approach which clearly \ncapture our policies, commitments, activities, projects \nand achievements in each area. We want to be as \ntransparent as possible; we want to be open, and \nwe comply with international standards. We are \ncommitted to the UN Sustainable Development Goals \n\u2013 so at the end of each chapter you will find a brief \noverview of everything we have done to meet these \ngoals in 2020. \nWe take ESG seriously. And we do it well. This has also \nbeen confirmed by the independent rating agency \nSustainalytics, a global leader in ESG company ratings. \nAn in-depth audit and a peer benchmark with other \ncompanies in the gas industry has given a clear result: \nthe GasNet score of 19.4 (Low Risk) places it among \nthe industry leaders (strong ESG management). \nYet we are still at the beginning and there are still \nmany challenges on the horizon. The European \nenergy sector is undergoing a fundamental change. \nThe Paris Agreement and the Green Deal for Europe \nset ambitious targets. Europe wants to reduce net \ncarbon dioxide emissions to zero and be climate \nneutral by 2050. As the domestic leader in natural gas \ndistribution, we are aware of our responsibility and are \ncommitted to playing a key role in the transformation \nof the Czech energy sector. We are convinced that, \nespecially in the context of the Czech Republic, \ndecarbonisation is not possible without natural gas \n\u2013 especially in road transport and in the heating \nsector, where it will be the only real and affordable \nreplacement for coal which is on its way out. New and \nrenewable gases such as biomethane or hydrogen will \nbecome increasingly important in the years to come. \nWe are already actively preparing for this today. We \nwelcome green energy and want to be a strong part of it.\nWe, however, see our contribution to a shared future in \na broader context: supporting communities, diversity, \nchildren and their potential, working with schools, \ndeveloping the skills of our employees, looking after \ntheir health and much more. \nThe year 2020 brought many great successes as well \nas challenges. Following the spin-off from the innogy \nGroup, we have succeeded in laying a solid foundation \nfor the already independent GasNet Group. Together, \nwe embarked on a new journey \u2013 with a new brand, \na\u00a0new corporate culture and a sustainable approach to \nour business.

We need to accelerate the transition towards new energy, \nimprove energy conversion efficiency with greater determination and \ncourage, so as to deal with climate change more professionally. \nSungrow always takes \u201cClean power for all\u201d as the mission of our \nbusiness, and is constantly committed to the research, development, \npromotion and application of clean energy conversion technologies. As \na responsible corporate citizen, we added a new topic on climate change \nin this year\u2019s report and disclosed the company's action plan to deal with \nclimate change. We have joined RE100. By constructing our own new \nenergy power plants, installing rooftop photovoltaic system in factories \nand engaging in green card transactions, we tried to increase the \nproportion of green energy use at an annual rate of 10% with the hope of \ncovering the use of green electricity in production and operation by 2028. \nWith the introduction of ISO14064 and 14067 standards, we have taken \nseveral measures to quantize the carbon emissions such as carrying out \ncarbon inventory and carbon footprint accounting. We have gradually \nestablished a scientific system for carbon emission management, and \npromoted the implementation of various emission and carbon reduction \nmeasures.\nIn the past year, Sungrow has strengthened ESG management, \ncontinued to improve the corporate governance system. Its increasing \nrevenue has brought more returns for shareholders. We continuously \noptimized the quality management system, promoted product and \ntechnology innovation, and responded quickly to meet customers\u2019 \nservice demands. We increased investment in safety production to \nprotect employees' occupational health and safety, accelerated the \ntraining of international talents, and promoted employees' dual-channel \ncareer development.

We are fighting this battle as the \nsole power generator fighting openly for an energy \nsector free from subsidies, a sector in which the \ncompetition provides the motivation for bringing the \nprice of energy down and freeing consumers who are \ncurrently hostages of a model driven by high inflation, \nthat drains incomes and limits the dreams of millions \nof Brazilians. As such, in 2021, we decided to assume \nthe role of protagonist, by publicly and transparently \ndefending regulatory changes that will allow Brazil\u2019s \nenergy (the cleanest and most affordable in the world) \nto achieve its full potential. Amongst the affirmative \nactions being adopted, we are contributing to the \napproval of a law that takes into consideration the \ninterests of society as a whole, establishing the new \nregulatory framework for Distributed Generation \n(DG), bringing an end to subsidies over the coming \nyears, which will save energy consumers billions of \nReais.

To this tragic toll, we must add a further \nsix wounded, one prisoner and two missing \nfrom our Ukrainian workforce.\nThese are terrible figures we would never \nhave wanted to report and which truly are a \ncause for reflection. \nWe would like to express our condolences and \nsolidarity to the families of the fallen and to \nall our colleagues who have been working in \nthe most challenging conditions for more than \na year now.\nOn a positive note, 2022 saw a reduction in \nthe severity of the Covid-19 pandemic and our \nproduction activity did not experience any \nrelated challenges.  \nIn cooperation with various humanitarian \norganisations, we continued to offer financial \nsupport to people still affected by the virus.\nInflationary pressure and rising costs, \nespecially for energy, which began in the \nsecond half of 2021, have reached levels that \nare unprecedented in recent history and are a \ngreat concern.\nDespite the reduction in production volumes, \nhigher sales prices resulted in higher turnover \nand EBITDA in absolute terms compared to \n2021.\nAs far as CO2 is concerned, with a reduction of \n5.9% in cementitious product, our absolute \nemissions were down 9.4%. Ukraine's lower \nproduction levels contributed in part to this \nresult. Thanks to higher production efficiency \nthan 2021, we avoided approximately 546 \nthousand tonnes of CO2.\nIn June 2022, we presented our roadmap, \n\u201cOur Journey to Net Zero\u201d. At the event, \nattended by a large number of national and \ninternational stakeholders, we explained \nin detail the path and conditions to achieve \ncarbon neutrality by 2050. To give more \nimpetus and credibility to our roadmap, we \nhave also defined an intermediate target \nfor 2030. This was recently validated by the \nSBTi (Science Based Target initiative), an \nauthoritative, independent, international \nbody, which has certified its compatibility \nwith the goals set by the 2015 Paris \nAgreement. \nThe year 2022 was also the deadline we had \nset for achieving important sustainability \ntargets that had been announced in 2017:\n\u2022\t a 5% reduction in our specific CO2 emissions \ncompared to 2017;\n\u2022\t the implementation of structural \nengagement projects in all our production \nsites with a high economic, environmental \nand social impact;\n\u2022\t the achievement of increasingly safe \nworking conditions.\nIt is with pride and satisfaction that we can \nconfirm that all the above goals have been \nachieved!\nFor this reason, we wish to thank everyone \nwho has contributed to this achievement \nthrough their tremendous determination and \nprofessionalism. \nWe are aware, however, that we still have a \nlong way to go. The goals for 2030 and 2050 \nroadmap will require a great deal of work and \nfinancial resources. \nSafeguarding health and safety at our production \nsites remains our most important goal. \nIn 2022, the LTIFR, the main frequency index \nfor injuries with absence from work, fell \nby 30% compared to 2017. Unfortunately, \nwe have to report two fatal accidents: \none involving a company employee in the \nCzech Republic and the other a contractor\u2019s \nemployee in Russia.\nAt an organisational level, we introduced \na new senior figure, the Corporate Safety \nManager, who is tasked with defining new \nstrategies to further improve our safety \nculture and accident rates.\nIn this report we continue with the \npublication of the information required by \nthe new Taxonomy Regulat", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Esso rappresenta un esempio virtuoso di come \niniziative di eccellenza possano contribuire a valorizzare \nil merito e la preparazione culturale delle migliori aziende \ndel nostro Paese.

Il ricordo va alle \ndiverse fasi di sviluppo della Buygreen Community, da cui \nil Sustainability Monitor Report discende, alle quali ho as\u00ad\nsistito e contribuito sin dalla sua gestazione, ormai, diver\u00ad\nsi anni orsono. Viene automatico ripensare a tutti gli sfor\u00ad\nzi e alle risorse profuse per dare forza e massa critica \nall\u2019iniziativa tali da identificarla come un club di eccellen\u00ad\nza delle grandi imprese italiane \u201cche guardano oltre\u201d.\nSi pu\u00f2 affermare che attualmente il consesso rappresen\u00ad\nti un punto di riferimento che opera in un contesto, pur\u00ad\ntroppo, caratterizzato da una non sempre brillante perfor\u00ad\nmance registrata da troppe imprese italiane nei confronti \ndell\u2019adozione dei criteri ambientali e sociali. Discutere \ne confrontarsi \u00e8 la chiave per fare in modo che questa \nanomalia del nostro Paese, che ci colloca con un piazza\u00ad\nmento, anche se non totalmente negativo, sicuramente \nmigliorabile in Europa per efficienza ambientale e sociale, \nvenga ridimensionata e si contribuisca a rispondere alla \npressante esigenza di scambiare esperienze tra perso\u00ad\nne che dedicano genuinamente il proprio contributo ad \ninvertire il poco promettente risultato. Queste le nobili \nmotivazioni che spingono la Fondazione Ecosistemi, con \nl\u2019autorevole partnership di Confindustria, ad alimentare il \nnetwork e a curare annualmente la realizzazione del Su\u00ad\nstainability Monitor Report. Lo studio \u00e8 condotto in uno \nscenario che esige livelli di professionalit\u00e0 molto elevati \nnel quale professionisti dei processi di acquisto sosteni\u00ad\nbili e circolari dimostrano di essere in grado di cogliere le \nopportunit\u00e0 offerte, dotando il settore delle pi\u00f9 aggiorna\u00ad\nte competenze tecniche ed operative.\nQuesta circostanza contribuisce a mitigare una metafora \ndei nostri giorni secondo la quale promuovere l\u2019adozio\u00ad\nne dei criteri ambientali e sociali negli acquisti diretti e \nindiretti rappresenta una \u201cricetta\u201d fondamentale per far \ncrescere l\u2019economia di un paese nel quale vi sono tut\u00ad\nti gli \u201cingredienti\u201d per creare una \u201cportata speciale\u201d, ma \nquesti vengono spesso lasciati, inspiegabilmente e in\u00ad\ncomprensibilmente, in frigorifero o in dispensa.

Mobility is among \nthose sectors undergoing one of the most transformational \ntechnological shifts. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the \nimmense potential of cycling because, while public transport \nwas used less in many cities, the use of bicycles increased \nenormously \u2013 and the urban growth potential is very high.1 In \nany case, electric vehicles are a key disruptive force in the \nmobility market.2 \n\u2022\t\nThe number of registrations of electric and hybrid vehicles \nhas increased significantly due to increasing urbanization \nand growing demand for micromobility solutions and \nhigher legal requirements for emission reduction. \n\u2022\t\nThe European market for e-bikes and EHVs (Electric & \nHybrid Vehicles) is forecast to grow by 43\u2009% and 22\u2009% per \nyear, respectively, from 2020 until 20253. \nDue to the strategic decision to focus on fast-growing, \nsustainable end markets, such as e-mobility, hGears has turned \nout to be one of the winners of this structural change. We seize \nthe right emerging opportunities and adapt our business and \noperating models swiftly. As winners of this change, we want to \ngive back not only to our investors, but to all the people who \ncome into contact with us or are affected by our business.\nMaking the rapid growth of the mobility market sustainable to \nall stakeholders \u2013 both from a production and a distribution \nperspective \u2013 is a challenge for us. But we love challenges and \nsince hGears is known for our \u201cwe can do it\u201d attitude, we take \nresponsibility for our results. We intend to tackle all of the \ntasks this involves in the areas of governance, people and \nplanet as ambitiously as the achievement of the best product \nperformance. We walk the talk.\nAs a supplier of first-class precision gears and components for \ne-mobility applications, we see our main task in supporting the \nshift to clean mobility, and we look forward to accompanying \nour many customers on this journey. However, a \u201cgreen\u201d \nbusiness model does not automatically make a company \nsustainable. That is why, just one year after hGears\u2019 IPO, we set \nourselves the goal of producing a Non-Financial Report in \nwhich we show our stakeholders, based on a broad data basis, \nour ongoing developments towards becoming an even more \nsustainable and responsible company.\nOur journey towards sustainability has only begun, but right \nfrom the start, we want to meet the high standards of the \nWorld Economic Forum (WEF) and the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI), and also make our contribution to the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), wherever we can. We \nwill selectively apply the recommendations of the WEF, the \nGRI, and the SDGs as far as reasonably possible.\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has \ndefined the following material topics for hGears\u2019 industry: \nenergy management, employee health and safety, product \nlifecycle management and business ethics. Improving \nperformance in these areas has a strong positive impact on the \noverall ESG rating of the company, however, even more \nimportantly, it will contribute to the world we live in. hGears\u2019 \nsustainability strategy therefore focuses on these metrics.\nPrinciples of Governance\nEnabling Corporate Responsibility\nIn this fast-changing world, our core values remain firm. We \nshow that growth and sustainability do not have to be \nopposites. We bring these dimensions together through unity, \ndiversity, integrity, and innovation.\nSustainability is part of our business model, one of our core \nvalues, and permeates all our corporate actions \u2013 from \ncorporate governance to our employees and all stakeholders \nwho interact with us.

The company is, in fact, continuing to invest \nin technologies and know-how in order to enable, on the \none hand, the evolution of the energy mix \u2013 from natural \ngas, just included in the EU legislation on taxonomy, to \nrenewables \u2013 and on the other hand in designing and \nsupplying solutions to reduce CO2 emissions in industrial \nsectors with a high carbon impact as preparation also for \nserving clients in sectors other than the energy supply \nchain.\nAt the same time, Saipem intends to contribute \u2013 right \nfrom the start \u2013 to energy decarbonisation along its \nvalue chain. In this way, the company will achieve the dual \neffect of reducing its carbon footprint and also that of its \nclients, towards whom it increasingly places itself as a \ntechnological ally on their path towards net-zero.\nThe company has adopted a two-fold strategy to \nachieve these objectives: on the one hand it proposes \nitself as a technology partner of energy companies for \ncomplex projects in order to implement them on the \npath to Net-Zero, and on the other hand as a supplier of \nmodular/scalable systems and solutions for the types of \napplications that capture CO2, recycle plastics or produce \nbiofuels that are becoming relevant for a growing number \nof industries.\nIn pursuing its objective as an enabler for the energy and \necological transition, Saipem also infuses its work with a \ncomplex of ESG factors, starting with its commitment to \nthe environment, which is also reflected in the Net-Zero \nprogramme launched by Saipem to reduce greenhouse \ngases with reference to Scope 1, 2 and 3 activities. \nEqually central to Saipem\u2019s work are health and workplace \nsafety, where protecting our workers is the primary asset, \ndefending Human Rights and business ethics, where \nattention to anti-corruption was validated in 2021 by the \nrenewal of ISO 37001:2016 certification. Saipem is also \ncommitted to its mission and to the international profile \nof its business to promote the inclusion and appreciation \nfor diversity and inclusion at all levels, both in terms of \nmulticulturalism, represented in Saipem\u2019s population, and in \nfostering gender equality, as well as integrity as a qualifying \ntransversal factor of corporate culture, and, last but not \nleast, attention to local communities where the company \noperates, supporting socio-economic development.\nAs an Italian company, Saipem feels even more \naccountable as a result of the recent introduction of the \nprinciple of protecting the environment, biodiversity and \necosystems into the Italian Constitutional Charter, also in \nthe interest of future generations. Likewise, the rules and \nprinciples that derive from European Union law and from \nthe main international events constitute a fundamental \nreference point for defining future strateg", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Safety, operational excellence and sustainable development go \nhand in hand. \n\u2022  Respect for each other is another TotalEnergies value and respect for human rights is a corner-\nstone of its Code of Conduct. \n\u2022 Zero Tolerance is the rule in the fight against corruption and fraud. \n\u2022 Transparency is the rule in engagement with society, whatever the subject. \n \nTotalEnergies\u2019 commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals has four dimensions addressed \nby this report: Climate and sustainable energy, People\u2019s well-being, Care for the environment and \nCreating shared value. TotalEnergies creates and drives positive change for communities in its \nhost territories and, more broadly, for its employees, suppliers, customers, partners, states and civil \nsociety.\nIn 2021, The UN Global Compact recognized TotalEnergies as a LEAD \nparticipant, as in 2020, 2019 and 2018. \nIn September 2021, TotalEnergies responded to the UN Energy initiative by establishing an Energy  \nCompact in which we announce the concrete measures we are going to implement to promote \naccess to clean and affordable energy for all by 2030 (SDG7). We estimate that, of the 100 GW of \nrenewable electricity we will install by 2030, some 33 GW will be located in emerging or developing \ncountries, providing sustainable energy to around 40 million people, some of whom will never have \nhad decent access to energy.\nIn 2021/2022, we are deploying a participatory approach to SDG training for all the Company\u2019s \nemployees, in order to involve them in the establishment of a sustainable development barometer \nthat TotalEnergies will publish as of 2023. \nTotalEnergies, a member of the UN Global Compact, \nsupporting the Sustainable Development Goals since 2016\n\u2014\nTotalEnergies places sustainable development in all its dimensions \nat the heart of its strategy, projects and operations to contribute to \npeople\u2019s well-being and aims to be a benchmark for endorsement \nof the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals. \n\nSustainability & Climate 2022 Progress Report \nTable of contents\n1.

Even through difficult \ntimes, it has been rewarded by consumer choices, a testament \nto its unique character and extraordinary qualities in terms of \nhealth, safety, and recyclability. Glass is an infinite resource \nwith ancient roots that is becoming increasingly popular.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Zignago Vetro Group has \nsuccessfully pursued economic and sustainable growth, despite \nthe complex general economic and geopolitical conditions. \nWe have faced soaring production factor costs, particularly \nin energy, raw materials, packaging, transportation, and other \nareas. Additionally, we witnessed a conflict erupt in the heart \nof Europe. \nHowever, this year we also left behind the pandemic and its \nrestrictions, resuming the pleasure of social relationships and \neveryday life. \nWe experienced a year of \nhard and constructive work \non the sustainability front, \none that saw us pursue our \npre-stated objectives with \nboth determination and \nperseverance, while also \nadding challenging new goals \nand important milestones to the \nmix. \nThe percentage of our production made from post-consumer \nrecycled glass (PCR) increased yet again, surpassing \nour targets and reaching 53.4%. Glass is the undisputed \nfrontrunner in terms of recyclability as it can be fully recycled \nindefinitely without compromising the quality of the resulting \ncontainer. No other material comes close to competing with \nthe intrinsic properties of glass. We have therefore set ourselves \neven more challenging recycling goals, despite the glass cutlet \ncollection and processing market being highly competitive and \nspeculative. Julia Vitrum S.p.A., our new company and the third \nGroup initiative in the glass recycling sector, has grown steadily \nand is now a point of reference in the circular economy and \nlocal reuse field in North-East Italy. \nMeanwhile, Zignago Vetro has installed a new furnace at its \nFossalta di Portogruaro facility, guaranteeing significantly \nimproved sustainability and energy efficiency. This allows the \nGroup to produce fewer emissions and make significant energy \nsavings while producing an identical product. \nThe amount of energy consumed to produce a tonne of glass \ndecreased by -2.4% compared to the previous year, and the \nGroup intends to decrease this figure by an additional -13% by \n2030. The share of electricity from renewable sources remained \nhigh at nearly 45% of the total, which is impressive considering \nthe extremely challenging energy market context. We also made \ngreat progress in terms of water consumption in 2022: further \ninvestments and increasingly prudent industrial management \nallowed us to reduce our water consumption per tonne of \nmolten glass by more than -36%, and we have confirmed some \nvery ambitious strategic targets. The energy market, specifically \nthe gas market, experienced severe tensions, threatening \nproduction disruptions due to supply interruptions. Despite these \nchallenges, Zignago Vetro responded with its characteristic \nflexibility, redirecting energy sources to guarantee operational \ncontinuity. However, the ongoing situation did hinder our target \nof reducing CO\u2082 emissions per tonne of molten glass, which \nnevertheless remains a crucial long-term goal for the Group.\nWe have undertaken several initiatives to support worthy \nenvironmental, social, and cultural causes. Some of these \ninclude contributions to reforestation initiatives, seabed clean-\nup activities, sustainable winemaking (Gambero Rosso award), \nand the provision of aid to local institutions supporting people \nand families in need, and to health care facilities. Finally, we \nsupported several cultural initiatives. The Group continued its \n\u201cZignago Vetro e l\u2019Arte\u201d project in 2022, which supports artists \nand the arts, including glass art. This involved sponsoring the \nMazzotti Gambrinus literary prize.\nWe made a", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

It has long fostered close relationships with its natural rubber suppliers, \nfocusing not only on ensuring quality but also pushing for environmentally \nsound processes.  \nThrough 2014, intentional and open conversation with its stakeholders con-\nvinced Michelin that it was essential to garner strong commitment towards sus-\ntainable environmental and social practices throughout the whole of its natural \nrubber supply chain and in the broader market.  \nMichelin\u2019s efforts toward sustainable natural rubber were catalyzed by its part-\nnership with WWF France, which supported Michelin to craft out a set of com-\nmitments relating to the sustainable procurement of natural rubber in 2015. \nThese commitments where expanded on in 2016 with Michelin\u2019s Sustainable \nNatural Rubber Policy, the first comprehensive policy relating to sourcing of \nsustainable natural rubber. \nMichelin has also been actively involved in promoting change throughout the \nindustry, and has been a long time member of the IRSG Sustainable Natural \nRubber initiative (SNR-i). WWF and Michelin also collectively participated in the \ncreation and launch of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber \n(GPSNR). \nThe past five years have been spent laying important groundwork in an indus-\ntry where sustainability and assessment frameworks were novel and untested. \nSignificant resources have been spent on championing the use of sustainability \nassessment tools across the industry and even on creating novel tools where \nthey had not existed before. We have made much progress, but there is plenty \nof work to do to effect lasting change throughout the entire supply chain.  \nThis year 2020 has been especially challenging for Michelin, our suppliers and \nthe millions of smallholder farmers that produce natural rubber, as the pan-\ndemic has stifled global demand. Nevertheless, we remain, more than ever, \ncommitted, and are continuing to work hard with our partners and global net-\nwork to build a truly sustainable natural rubber supply chain.

A key part of our \napproach has been to develop a framework to \nassess our natural rubber value chain. \nSignificant resources have been spent to drive the \nwider industry to adopt these assessments and \ntools. The smallholder-dominated nature of natural \nrubber production has been particularly challeng-\ning, made even more complex by the fact that mul-\ntiple tiers of intermediaries exist between small-\nholders and natural rubber processing factories. To \novercome this, Michelin developed a novel solution \nto facilitate smallholder risk-mapping at a jurisdic-\ntional level: Rubberway\u00ae. \nComplementing this top-down approach of assess-\nments and risk mapping has been a commitment to \neffect change through direct action on the ground. \nThis has been conducted through the Group\u2019s joint-\nventures and partnerships, such as the Royal Les-\ntari Utama project, an integrated natural rubber \ncompany aiming at producing climate smart, wild-\nlife friendly and socially incl", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

In a year \nfilled with unknowns, the ABM helped us surmount \nthose challenges. When our people couldn\u2019t travel, we \nmoved to virtual meetings and found ways to provide \nservice and support to suppliers and customers through \ndigital tools. When a customer needed to deliver \nCOVID-19 rapid test kits on an exceptionally tight \ntimeline, we were able to compress a 40-week job into \n14 weeks. So, while the year and the challenges were \nunprecedented, ATS ran true to form, embracing \ninnovation to meet customers\u2019\u00a0needs.\nMessage \nfrom Our CEO\nI am pleased to present our \nsecond annual sustainability report. \nIt covers fiscal year 2021, a year \nwhich started with great uncertainty \nfor ATS and our customers as the \nCOVID-19 pandemic spread across \nthe globe. We met those challenges \nand kept our commitments to our \ncustomers and communities, \nthanks to the energy, imagination \nand dedication of our people.\nAcross the Company, our commitment to continually \nimproving our ESG performance and reporting is stronger \nthan ever. Over the year, we were able to build on our \nESG foundation, with our greatest focus being on the \nhealth, safety and mental wellbeing of our employees.\nEarly in the pandemic, at all of our operations, we \nhelped employees who did not need to stay on site \nmake the transition to working effectively from home. \nAt the same time, we supported site-essential \nemployees by having protocols and systems in place \nto make their\u00a0work environments as safe as possible. \nOver this time, our pandemic response was shaped by \n\u201cForward Together,\u201d our playbook for workplace \nwellbeing.

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "On behalf of the Trustees of the TfL Pension Fund (the \u201cFund\u201d), I am \npleased to present our third Annual Report on Sustainable Investing. The \nreport builds on our experience from the last two years in significant ways \nbut at the same time preserves important learning threads and the Fund\u2019s \ncore investment beliefs. Sustainability is an evolutionary process for the \nTrustees, embracing key changes based on well thought through framework \nand evidence, but at the same time being bold and leapfrogging where \nbenefits are clear-cut. The adoption of TCFD (Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures) reporting, well ahead of the regulatory \nrequirements, is a good example of that.\nThe Trustees continue to use all three building blocks of Sustainable \nInvesting, namely targeting better Environmental, Social and Governance \noutcomes for the Fund\u2019s portfolio of public and private companies. This is \nseen as key part of a robust risk management process, consistent with the \nlong-term investment horizon of the Fund. ESG now makes up a significant \npart of the Trustees\u2019 ongoing dialogue with the Fund\u2019s managers and the \nadviser as part of a fully integrated investment process. Another important \ndevelopment this year was the appointment of Sustainalytics as the Fund\u2019s \nvoting and engagement partner. This would help to materially step up our \nactivities in this area and complement the ESG integration process.  \nIt is fair to say that whilst the Trustees have achieved a lot, there is an \nhonest acknowledgement that more should and will be done. Some \nof it will be driven by better understanding and evaluation of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs involved, and that would require continuous learning \nand following (or in some cases setting) the \u201cindustry best practices\u201d. \nRegulation \u2013 both local and global \u2013 will be the other catalyst for the \nchange. The Trustees expect to be pro-active on both fronts. \nUltimately, sustainability is not just about managing risks, but also making \nprofitable investments in areas that will be part of the solution \u2013 more \nimportant than ever in the Covid-19 \u201cnew normal\u201d. The Trustees will \ncontinue to build on the strong momentum in this area, expecting to \nincrease allocation to \u201cESG tilted\u201d investments.\nI trust you find the report interesting, engaging and above \nall helpful to better understand the Trustees\u2019 approach in \nthis area.\nMaria Antoniou\nChair, TfL Pension Fund\nTfL Pension Fund\n2020 Report on Sustainable Investing\nExecutive Summary:\n\t\nIn recent years ESG investing has gained a real foothold in the investment \nindustry and in the wider society at large. Once considered niche by \nsome in the financial markets, ESG and sustainable investing is now regularly \nin the mainstream media and is expected to continue to grow rapidly over the \ncoming years.\n\t\nThis is the third year the Fund has published its Sustainable Investing \nAnnual Report and we are pleased to be able to share this now with \nyou. This Report captures the on-going efforts and evolving activities the Fund \nhas undertaken during 2019/20 as it continues along its important journey to \nintegrate ESG considerations across all of its investments. As we go to publish, \nESG issues have never been as important than they are right now, especially \nfollowing the devastating social and economic havoc wreaked by the COVID-19 \npandemic.\n\t\nAs a provider of responsible long-term capital, the Trustees strongly \nbelieve that the Fund should be an agent of positive change, \ncollaborating with like-minded investors and engaging with companies to invest \nits members\u2019 pension money sustainably and responsibly.\n\t\nThe Trustees recognise that transparency and disclosure of its ESG \nPolicy and related activities in this area is a key component of being a \nresponsible investor.\n\t\nThe Fund continues to employ the \u201cRISEN\u201d framework to reinforce its \nlong-term thinking in this area (see page 3 of this Report).\n\t\n2020 was another busy year with the Fund continuing to adapt to stay \nahead of an evolving ESG regulatory landscape. The Fund updated its \nStatement of Investment Principles (\u201cSIP\u201d) in March this year following further \nregulatory changes to the requirements for the SIP. More changes are expected \nnext year. \n\t\nIn the twelve months to 31 March 2020, carbon emissions across the \nFund\u2019s active equity and bond portfolio declined a further 3.4% and since \n2017 have fallen significantly by around 26% (see page 5 of this report).\n\t\nAcross its corporate bond portfolio, the Fund delivered a 50% reduction \nin carbon emission intensity versus the benchmark (see page 5).\n\t\n68 companies excluded across the Fund\u2019s active segregated mandates, \nbased on the criterion that the companies derived 30% or more of their \nrevenues from either thermal coal extraction or thermal coal electric generation.\n\t\nThe Fund was an early voluntary adopter of the Task Force on Climate \nRelated Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) in its annual Report & Accounts \nfor 2020 (see", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The challenges are complex and constantly evolving, but we remain focused \non the four pillars that shape the Mytheresa Commitment: MYPLANET, MYTALENT, \nMYPRODUCT and MYPOLICY. With each of these pillars, we\u2019ve set concrete, ambitious \nand measurable goals and we\u2019ve made meaningful strides toward our objectives:\nLIMITING OUR IMPACT ON THE PLANET\nWe made significant progress toward our goal to use only renewable electricity in our \nbusiness, reaching 92% in all operations over which we have control. This means that \nthe majority of our offices run on clean electricity. Similarly, we were able to significantly \nreduce our waste and use of single-use plastics, and we will continue to do our utmost to \nincrease the share of recycled waste. \nFOSTERING RESPONSIBLE SOURCING \nFollowing the implementation of our Animal Welfare Policy, banning exotic skins from \nSpring / Summer 2021 onwards and fur from Spring / Summer 2022 onwards, we \nare pleased that at the end of December 2022 our website was already completely \nfree of products containing exotic skins and furs, as defined in our policy. Furthermore, \nwe have now updated our policy to ban additional animal-derived materials and we \nare restricting our procurement of products containing angora and rabbit hairs. To \nfoster responsible sourcing, we have also created the Mytheresa responsible sourcing \nguidance. This document provides our brand partners with pragmatic steps that aim \nto inspire a collaborative approach to creating products using practices that are more \nrespectful of our planet, wildlife, and people - including, of course, our customers.\nFOSTERING RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION\nWe are equally pleased with our efforts to support the circular economy via our \npartnership with Bucherer. With this launch, we now offer our high-end customers in \nEurope, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom an opportunity to purchase Certified Pre-\nOwned luxury watches from brands such as Audemars Piguet or Omega. In addition, our \npartnership with the leading global platform for desirable pre-loved fashion, Vestiaire \nCollective, was rolled out to some of our US customers after the successful launch in \nEurope in June 2021. The products sold within this program for FY 23 have a total \nbuyback value of approximately \u20ac4.2 million. \nFOSTERING DIVERSITY & INCLUSION\nWe are continuously fostering diversity and equal opportunities within our company \nthrough a diverse, fair, inclusive and positive culture. Since the introduction of Diversity \n& Inclusion in our values in 2021, we implemented a mandatory training that is part of \nthe onboarding of our new team members, as well as numerous lectures and workshops. \nWe also ensure equal opportunities for all genders by a", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

I encourage \nyou to read the pages ahead to learn more \nabout Trans Mountain\u2019s practices and \nthe progress we are making on our ESG \ncommitments. As a Board, we continue \nto take an active role in overseeing the \nmanagement of the company\u2019s ESG  \nrisks and opportunities.\nIn August 2022, the Board appointed Dawn Farrell to \nthe position of President and Chief Executive Officer \nand member of the Board of Directors. We were \nconfident that her broad-based knowledge, experience, \nand her background with governments and Indigenous \ncommunities would be a tremendous asset to \nTrans\u00a0Mountain as it completed the Expansion Project \nand navigated the next stages of the company\u2019s future. \nThis has proven to be true.\nEach day, we are closer to completion of our  \nExpansion Project and to realizing the benefits that  \nthe expanded pipeline and marine terminal will bring \nto the Canadian economy. After construction is \ncompleted, we expect approximately 700 new jobs \nwill be created to support continuing operations, \nrepresenting an increase of ~75\u00a0per cent of our \nworkforce. More importantly, unlocking access to \nglobal markets will enable Canadian energy producers \nto achieve world prices for oil exported to the \nUnited\u00a0States and Asia, forecasted to remain robust \nfor decades to come. This will ultimately mean greater \nprosperity for all Canadians with higher tax revenues \nhelping to fund essential programs and services.\nTrans Mountain continues to steward best practices \nwith respect to ESG issues. When it comes to building \nmajor infrastructure projects, Canada has among \nthe world\u2019s highest standards for the protection of \npeople, preservation of the environment, as well \nas consultation and engagement with Indigenous \ncommunities. These standards have been embedded \ninto the Expansion Project design and construction \nmethodologies and will continue to guide how the \ncompany operates when the expansion is complete.\nThe Trans Mountain Expansion Project has an \nimportant role to play in economic reconciliation \nwith Indigenous communities. Trans Mountain\u2019s \nrelationships with Indigenous communities are \nbased on trust and respect. We continue to identify \nopportunities to create significant economic and \nemployment opportunities for Indigenous, local,  \nand regional workers across the pipeline corridor, \nduring the expansion phase and into the future.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to \noffer my thanks to all Trans Mountain employees and \ncontractors for their hard work and commitment.  \nYour contributions are making it possible to continue to \ntransport oil safely and responsibly to the West\u00a0Coast, \nand your efforts have been essential to reaching \nimportant Expansion Project milestones. We have \nconfidence that together we will continue to meet  \nthe ambitious objectives we set togeth", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The unfolding war in Europe, \nthe cost-of living crisis, the after-effects of the pandemic and the continuing climate emergency \nare impacting individuals across the world and will continue to do so. \nEurope's efforts to work toward a more sustainable future has become an even greater task since \nthe outbreak of Ukraine war. Energy supply has been squeezed, global commodities as well as food \nprices have increased, and green plans have been derailed. \nBut in challenge there is possibility. The war has shown us the urgency of resolving the question of \nenergy security. It should give us greater motivation and focus in our work towards a greener future. \nUniCredit has always been committed to a fair and just energy transition. We recognise that the \nlonger-term global threat of climate change remains unchanged and ever more pressing. We only \nneed to look at the 30 million people recently displaced in Pakistan, or the devastating effects of \nthe floods in Germany and Italy to see this.\nWe are committed to supporting our clients through any challenges they face in this transition. \nThis includes helping them adapt to a rapidly-changing energy landscape. This year we joined the \nNet-Zero Banking Alliance, which means we have committed to achieve Net Zero emissions from \nour operations by 2030 and from our financing portfolio by 2050. This is just one of many steps \ntaken. \nThroughout all of this, we must remain conscious that the journey to a green future does not exist \nin isolation. For every decision we make to be more environmental, we must consider how this \nimpacts our Social agenda. We must find a way through that serves both agendas, and leaves no \none behind. \nUniCredit's purpose of empowering communities to progress means taking every aspect of ESG \ninto account and finding solutions that help all the individuals and communities we serve at every \nstage. This is about being more sustainable, but it is also about giving them what they need to \nsucceed through this transition. \nLetter from the \nChief Executive \nOfficer\n\n3\nUniCredit 2021 TCFD Report\nMessage from \nHead of Group \nStrategy & ESG\nThe context in which we publish our TCFD report is one of a world beset by mounting crises \nof global importance. We are faced with a strained global economy already suffering from the \neffects of the pandemic as well as supply chains under significant stress, all compounded by ever \nconstricted energy markets and escalating global commodity prices. The war in Ukraine has only \nexacerbated these adverse trends and the economic and humanitarian repercussions of rising \ncosts of energy and food are intensifying. \nThese disruptions occur in the broader and ongoing context of an ever-present climate crisis, \nwhose effective mitigation will require a global transition to a low-carbon economy. If we are to \nlimit global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius and stay on track to meet the ambitious goals set \nout in the Paris Agreement, we need to make a collective effort to accelerate the transition of the \nglobal economy.\nHowever, in amongst the adversity we can find opportunity, and it is more important than ever \nthat we see the possibilities in this transition; the required economic transformation will not only \ncreate immediate commercial opportunities but also open up the prospect of a fundamentally \ntransformed global economy with lower energy costs being one of numerous benefits, including \nimproved health outcomes and enhanced conservation of natural capital. The transition will also \nbring new growth opportunities, as decarbonization creates efficiencies and opens markets for \nlow-emissions products and services.\nEffective actions to accelerate decarbonization include shifting the energy mix away from fossil \nfuels, increasing energy efficiency and managing demand for energy. In the short term it is clear \nthat the war will complicate th", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

What can you \ntell us about the role that \nUn\u00e9dic played during this \nperiod?\nUn\u00e9dic manages unemployment insurance by \nstaying as close as possible to the realities of \nemployment while being attentive to the needs \nof employers, ensuring that jobs are protected.\nIn the first half of 2021, the unemployment \ninsurance scheme proved its strength again: it \nhelped compensate jobseekers and finance the \nfurloughing scheme for millions of employees \nwithin thousands of companies. It has record \nlevels of debt. But this debt is necessary to \nfund the emergency measures. For example, \n\u20ac2.5 billion was specifically allocated to the \nfurloughing scheme.\nThen, in the second half of the year, the \nfavourable economic situation and the \nexceptional rebound in employment, which \nwe observed, helped to put unemployment \ninsurance back on a path of return to financial \nequilibrium.\nHow does Un\u00e9dic \nensure a controlled \nfinancial management of \nunemployment insurance?\nThe ability of the unemployment insurance \nscheme to adapt allows it to fully play its role \nas a social buffer, especially when required by \neconomic, health and geopolitical crises.\nThroughout 2021, Un\u00e9dic anticipated and \nadjusted its funding needs. Debt management \nremains efficient and controlled, under the agile \nand reactive management of the social partners, \nrepresenting the 27 million employees and 2 \nmillion employers.\nThe social partners can draw on the expertise \nof Un\u00e9dic\u2019s services: our integrated and \nmultidisciplinary approach helps to understand \nthe effects of the country\u2019s economic situation \non employment and, consequently, on \nunemployment insurance. In particular, we \nmake three annual financial forecasts to adjust \nthe scheme\u2019s financial trajectory, in addition \nto ensuring its proper implementation in \nconjunction with employment ecosystem \noperators, and thus protect jobseekers, \nemployees and businesses.\nYou publish your second \nreport on the allocation \nand impact of funds raised \nthrough Social Bond issues. \nWhat is the purpose of such \na report?\nAs in the previous report, this report on the \nallocation and impact of social-bond issues \nspecifies, through detailed indicators, the source, \nuse, method of distribution and beneficiaries of \nsuch funding. In 2021, we carried out four issues \nof Social Bonds on the financial markets in the \ntotal amount of \u20ac10 billion. This support is aimed \nprimarily at vulnerable groups of the population, \nas defined in the Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs), who are most exposed to the risks of job \nloss and difficulties in returning to sustainable \nemployment.\nThe report thus reflects part of Un\u00e9dic\u2019s direct \ncontribution to the 2030 Agenda and France\u2019s \ncommitments under this universal agenda for \nsustainable development.\nFor more than 60 years, Un\u00e9dic has been \nconsolidating and updating the Unemployment \nInsurance scheme, which is both an insurance \nand solidarity-based scheme with a long-term \nfinancial trajectory. We remain and will remain \nmobilised to guarantee the strength of this pillar \nof the French social model, in the service of \nsocial cohesion and in support of the economy.\n\n1\nUn\u00e9dic, an \nEconomic and \nSocial Buffer\n1\n\nAllocation and Impact Reporting - Social Bonds 2021 - Un\u00e9dic\n5\nUn\u00e9dic and its partners: key players \nof the public employment service\nEmployees, companies and jobseekers\nASP\nPays furloughing \nscheme allowance\nAGIRC-ARRCO\nManages pension \ncontributions \nand credits of jobseekers \nreceiving bene\ufb01ts\nP\u00d4LE EMPLOI\nCalculates and pays bene\ufb01ts \nto jobseekers and helps them \nreturn to work\nL\u2019Un\u00e9dic is the body that manages \nunemployment insurance in \nFrance. \nThe scheme is funded by \ncontributions from private sector \nsalaries and the earned income \nbased general social contribution \n(GSC).\nFrom time to time, Un\u00e9dic may \nissue debt to finance its activity.\nThe management of benefits \nand aid financed by Un\u00e9dic \nis delegated to field-based \norganisations for beneficiaries \nof the unemployment insurance \nscheme.\nIn France, the general social contribution is a partially proportional tax that contributes to the financing of social security and, since 2018, unemployment insurance, instead of \nthe contributions levied on salaries.\n\nAllocation and Impact Reporting - Social Bonds 2021 - Un\u00e9dic\n6\nFrance\u2019s labour force :\n28.9 million\n1.2 million\nof which\n2.7 million\nOf which", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

UniCredit Global Research,\nthrough a partnership agreement with oekom, has the exclusive right to produce and market RI \nResearch utilizing oekom's published expertise. UniCredit's commitment to environmental, \nsocial and governance (ESG) principles is set out in our extensive series of Sustainability \nReports, issued each year alongside the group's annual reporting structure. \nThe concept of Responsible Investment (RI) is gaining momentum in the global financial \nsystem, with USD 84 bn of assets under management dedicated and over USD 15 tn committed \nto it. Although connotations vary from responsible, sustainable, ethical to socially responsible\ninvesting (SRI), the underlying principle is common: the integration of ESG issues into \ntraditional investment analysis and assessment.  \nThe challenge for investors remains on how to adapt best to the ongoing change, where the\ncurrently dominant shareholder wealth maximization approach clashes with the stakeholder \none. ESG risk analysis integration not only remains a challenge for mainstream financial\nanalysis, but also for portfolio management.  \nOur research addresses these challenges by providing investors with an analytical framework\nfor ESG risk integration into modern portfolio management.

The striking images of \nthe devastation that the event caused in Germany and \nBelgium made it abundantly clear that climate change is no \nlonger just an abstract scientific problem. The impact of \nclimate change is only going to become more significant, \nand we are not going to be immune to its effects in this part \nof the world.\nThe events in the summer of 2021 provided yet more evi-\ndence that limiting global warming and protecting the \nnatural resources required for life on earth are one of the \nmost important challenges facing us as a society. That is \nwhy environmental and climate protection have such an \nimportant role to play in our sustainability strategy. We \nsupport targets set at an international level, such as the \n1.5\u00b0C target set out in the Paris Agreement and the European \nUnion Green Deal, as well as the goal set by the German \nFederal Government in 2021 to achieve climate neutrality by \n2045. The Austrian government is going even further, and \nwants to be climate neutral by 2040. The world of business \nhas an active role to play in achieving this target. It can also \ndrive the research and development that will be needed in \norder to reach global climate targets. The real estate sector \nhas an important part to play in this because the construc-\ntion and operation of buildings emit a significant amount of \nthe greenhouse gases that cause climate change. As the \nhousing industry market leader in Europe, we aim to be a \ncentral driving force behind climate protection. With a \nportfolio of 413,967 residential units (excl. Deutsche \nWohnen) in Germany, Austria and Sweden and its involve-\nment in a number of wide-ranging development activities, \n\u00adVonovia has a significant role to play in protecting our \nenvironment and mitigating climate change. \n > Climate path for the existing German portfolio \nupdated: virtually climate-neutral building \nportfolio by 2045 set as target (<25 kg CO\u2082e/m\u00b2 \nby 2030)\n > Carbon intensity in Germany improved by 2.8% \nto 38.4 kg CO2e/m\u00b2\n > 2.3% refurbishment rate achieved in Germany\n > Decarbonization tool for implementing environ-\nmental targets on regional and neighborhood \nlevels.

Residential real estate companies can \nmake an important contribution in this area while also \nopening up new business areas for themselves. Their prop-\nerties offer great potential for generating renewable ener-\ngies, e.g., by using photovoltaic or solar thermal installations \non roofs. This provides the basis for innovative schemes like \nlandlord-to-tenant electricity models\u202f\u2013 prospectively also for \nheat pumps and charging infrastructure. This approach puts \n\u00adVonovia in a position to make use of the opportunities that \nwill arise as a result of our increasing demand for renewable \nenergy and the transformation underway in the transport \nand energy sectors. We also believe that there is significant \npotential for \u00adVonovia to drive innovation within the residen-\ntial property sector while remaining at the forefront of the \nenergy revolution and achieving our own climate targets. Of \ncourse, we need a suitable statutory and technological \nframework in order for this to be successful.\nClimate action and protecting the environment are becom-\ning increasingly relevant topics in wider society.

While Valneva\nwas not required to issue a CSR report under the new law,\nthe Company decided to voluntarily continue its reporting for\n2018. In 2019, with the Group having crossed the threshold of\n500 employees, it became subject to the obligation to\npublish non-financial information. Thus, the present report\ndescribes not only the risks faced by the Company in its\npursuit of sustainable growth, but also shows the counter\nmeasures put in place and Valneva\u2019s future plans to minimize\nthese challenges. \nValneva\u2019s CSR strategy remains centered upon four pillars,\nwhich are reflected in the organization of this report:\nProtecting Lives, Acting Ethically, Developing our People,\nand Respecting the Environment.\nThe scope of reporting retained in 2021 covers sites in the UK\n(Livingston and London-Fleet), Sweden (Solna), Austria\n(Vienna), Canada (Montr\u00e9al-Kirkland), the U.S. (Washington,\nD.C.-Gaithersburg) and France (Nantes-Saint-Herblain and\nLyon), or 100% of the Group\u2019s total headcount.\nValneva\u2019s environmental impact data come from its two\nproduction sites and two R&D sites. Together, these four\nsites represent more than 97% of the Group\u2019s total\nheadcount in 2021.\nThe environmental impact of Valneva\u2019s commercial offices is\nnot integrated into the scope of this Report.\nPursuant \nto \nArticle \n8 \nof \nthe \nTaxonomy \nRegulation\n(Regulation (EU) 2020/852), companies having to issue a\nCSR report will have to publish sustainability indicators from\nJanuary 1, 2022.\n1\n\nMessage from the Management\nCorporate Social Responsibility\n2.\nMessage from the Management\nCorporate Social Responsibility is critical to Valneva as we\nstrive to advance vaccines for better lives. Our daily activities\nare guided by a concern for protecting lives, conducting\nbusiness ethically, developing our workforce and preserving\nthe environment. The risks inherent to this work are carefully\nconsidered at all levels of the organization, where we\ncollectively endeavor to mitigate them as we drive for\ncontinued growth. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought on a sustained,\nheightened awareness of the public health danger that\ninfectious diseases represent. Valneva, a specialty vaccine\ncompany \nfocused \non \nthe \ndevelopment \nand\ncommercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious\ndiseases with significant unmet medical need, proudly\nrecognizes its responsibility to help protect against these\nkinds of threats.\nSince its creation in 2013, Valneva has worked on potential\nprotective measures against dangerous illnesses such as\nJapanese encephalitis, cholera, Lyme disease, chikungunya\nand now, COVID-19. The Company continues to invest in\nResearch & Development, in an effort to bring us closer a\nworld \nin \nwhich \nno \none \ndies \nor \nsuffers \nfrom \na\nvaccine-preventable disease.

Because we recognise \nthat sustainability and ESG are linked to the performance, value and \nreputation of all infrastructure investments. In 2019, we were reminded of \nthis fundamental truth by climate protests, growing scrutiny of corporate \nsocial purpose, renationalisation agendas in the UK and the continued \ngrowth in ESG regulations and guidance, including the quest for increased \ntransparency under initiatives such as the EU Taxonomy.\nAs stewards of investor capital, we have chosen to place sustainability as \nthe keystone of our investment activities.

We have adopted \na cogent ESG strategy, developed proprietary risk assessment tools, \nelevated our ESG client reporting and launched a thought leadership \nprogramme. We have also implemented comprehensive staff training, \nintroduced diversity measurement and reporting and are now issuing this \ninaugural Sustainability Report.\nOur steadfast commitment to ESG and sustainable investing has been \nacknowledged externally.

This is a very good situation, but one \nthat entails great responsibility, too. We are able to help ensure that people in cities have homes worth living in. \n\u00adHow\u00adever, it is also a challenging position. It puts our company under the microscope for a number of stakeholder \ngroups, who all have very different expectations from us. \nWe investigate these expectations immediately because we want to fulfil them, as far as they fall under our responsibili-\nties, to the fullest extent possible. This isn\u2019t always an easy task. Finding solutions to varying demands often involves \ncompromise. But by maintaining dialogue we are always able to bring different points of view together. \nOur business approach is also helpful in this regard. As a service provider and the provider of homes for around one \nmillion people, our focus is on our customers and their needs. With this in mind, we preserve our buildings and actively \nshape the residential environment. This is also why we are committed to offering contemporary, senior-friendly apart-\nments and developing services that offer better quality of living. Our focus on customers is also the reason why we are \naddressing a social issue that is particularly important at the moment: the construction of new apartments. \nLast year we began construction work on more than 1,000 apartments; in the coming years it will be significantly more. \nThe new apartments will not be constructed just anywhere, but where they are needed: in conurbations. The average \nrent for the apartments in our portfolio is around \u20ac6.50 per m2. This is affordable for the large majority of people. \nTo some extent, we also consider it our responsibility to ensure that people can live together in their neighborhoods \nharmoniously. That is why we are implementing comprehensive neighborhood projects throughout Germany, cooperat-\ning with charities, promoting cultural and neighborhood projects and working closely with the local communities. In the \npast year alone, we invested \u20ac50 million in neighborhood projects like this. We also donate money through our founda-\ntions. It is also our aim to understand interaction in our neighborhoods better and are therefore actively investing in \nresearch in this area. We are financing an endowed professorship in Bochum for research into neighborhood develop-\nment.\nWe support the German government\u2019s ambitious target of achieving an almost climate-neutral building stock by 2050 \nthrough a number of measures to reduce energy consumption and the release of CO2e emissions. Implementing energy-\u00ad\nefficiency modernizations and maintaining buildings are important measures in this regard. We were able to achieve a \nrefurbishment rate of 5% once more in 2018 and thereby significantly improve the energy intensity of many buildings. \nThis shows that we are on the right track. \n\u2002102-14\n\n Vonovia SE Sustainability Report 2018\nEDITORIAL\n4\nI\u2019m pleased that we are also very popular as an employer now, too. Almost 10,000 people work for us \nnow \u2013 around 1,000 of those are located in Austria and Sweden. The majority of our employees is in  \ndirect contact with our customers, which also makes their work very valuable in a social sense.

Our research \nshows an increase in the use of reasonable assurance, \nalthough external assurance, regardless of the level  \nof validation, is not yet used to its full potential.\n3\nCompanies have made better progress on experience than \non content in 2014. In particular, connectivity across key \naspects of reported content, such as materiality, targets  \nand performance, has improved.\n4\nStand-alone sustainability reports remain the dominant  \nform of non-financial disclosure, with the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI) being the most widely used guidelines  \nand its fourth generation (G4) version benefitting from \nrapid uptake.\n5\nThe proportion of companies that are combining their \nfinancial and non-financial reporting into either annual \nreports or self-declared integrated reports remain  \nconstant at around 20% with half of them referring  \nto the International Integrated Reporting Framework.\n01\nREPORTING MATTERS\nINTRODUCTION\nBACKGROUND\nDETAILED FINDINGS\nAPPENDIX\n\nShifting the focus to long term\nPaul Polman, CEO Unilever and Chairman WBCSD, shares his vision  \nand advice on how to build sustainability into business models.\nQ. How can the effectiveness of corporate \nreporting be improved to better drive \nintegrated thinking/performance \nmanagement? \nMore and more we see that companies which put \nsustainability at the heart of their models and who focus \non long-term decision-making are performing better \neconomically. A recent research summary by the University \nof Oxford Smith School, for example, showed that \ncompanies that implement sound sustainability practices \ndeliver better operational performance, benefit from a \nlower cost of capital and see a positive influence in stock \nprices. Equally, there is clear evidence elsewhere that \ncompanies that are overly focused on the short term  \nmiss investment opportunities and reduce their  \nlong-term value creation.\nSo based on the economic arguments alone, managers \nshould integrate sustainability into decision-making  \nand reporting.\nAnd that is what we are seeing. The WBSCD survey  \nof reporting in 2013 showed that the majority of large \ncompanies now have environmental and social goals \nand they report progress externally. 75% of member \ncompanies now follow GRI reporting guidelines.  \nAnd the majority get some form of external assurance  \nfor this reporting. \nIncreasingly it is clear that traditional financial metrics \nare not enough to support this and integrated reporting \nis the vital link to drive better integrated thinking and \nperformance management. It requires us to incorporate \nnon-financial metrics as well as financial metrics leading \nto a better understanding of how the organization creates \nvalue. This in turn enables management to focus on the \nright key performance indicators to drive progress against \nlong-term targets.\nQ. Unilever has stopped quarterly profit \nreporting since 2011. How would you describe \nthe impact of this decision on investor behavior? \nAnd on internal investment decisions?\nUnilever stopped giving short-term financial guidance \nin 2009 and moved away from full P&L quarterly profit \nreporting as from 2011. The impact on investors\u2019 behavior \nhas been mixed. While the move has helped in our efforts \nto attract longer-term investors to our register and to \nreduce the opportunities for short-term investors to trade \naround our quarterly announcements, there are still too \nmany investors who are mainly focused on the short term. \nHowever, we recognize that this is a journey and that to \nshift to a better balance between long and short term will \ntake time.\nInternally it has given us more freedom to run the business \nwithout needing to make arbitrary decisions around a  \n90-day financial reporting cycle. This makes it easier to take \nthe best investment decisions for the long term, whether \nit be investment in brand support, R&D or supply chain/IT \ncapital expenditure.\nWe would encourage all other companies to reduce \nshort-te", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Un \nnemico invisibile ha stravolto le nostre vite e ci ha \nimposto la distanza sociale come meccanismo di \ndifesa. La pandemia ha fatto emergere gli squilibri e le \ndisuguaglianze che minacciano la coesione sociale e le \ndifficolt\u00e0 nella costruzione di pratiche che garantiscano \nun futuro sostenibile, responsabile e inclusivo per tutti.\nAllo stesso tempo, il 2020 ha incubato il cambiamento \npi\u00f9 concentrato che abbiamo mai conosciuto: a causa \ndell\u2019emergenza sanitaria da Covid-19, in pochi mesi ci \nsiamo abituati a lavorare senza incontrarci, a imparare \na distanza, a celebrare insieme ma separati, grazie a \npiattaforme digitali. Ci siamo chiesti in passato quale \nsarebbe stato il principale motore della trasformazione \ndigitale delle aziende e delle societ\u00e0, se questo ruolo \nsarebbe stato assunto dagli Azionisti, dai manager o \ndalle istituzioni. Ebbene, la risposta che diamo oggi \u00e8 \nche quel motore \u00e8 stata la pandemia, che ci ha spinto \nad abbracciare la trasformazione digitale con una \nforza e una velocit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 grandi di quanto avremmo mai \nimmaginato. \nLa nostra nuova rete mobile, certificata Top Quality, ci \nha permesso di garantire la continuit\u00e0 del servizio con \nuna qualit\u00e0 molto alta, nonostante l\u2019aumento drastico \ndi traffico voce e dati. Le nostre iniziative rivolte ai \npi\u00f9 giovani hanno contribuito a garantire accesso \nall\u2019istruzione e a educare alla digitalizzazione durante \nl\u2019obbligo della Didattica a Distanza.

E lo sono anche perch\u00e9 quest\u2019anno siamo \nstati capaci di guardare ancora pi\u00f9 avanti.

It has been designed to be as enjoyable to \nread as a business magazine. This analogy is inspired by our strong belief that \ntaking ESG questions into account in our relationship with our portfolio companies, \ninvestors and employees creates lasting impacts on the world while unlocking sus-\ntainable long-term value and generating competitive returns.\nWhite Star Capital has formalized its environmental, social and governance policy \nin 2019 and has positioned itself to have a signi\ufb01cant impact on society and the \nenvironment. As investors, a decision to invest in a speci\ufb01c single company can not \nonly help to shape the wider economy, but also the current and future society that \nwe wish to live in. This tremendous responsibility is the reason we are so meticulous \nduring our selection and investment processes, and prefer to act as an active and \nlong-term partner. We also believe in the major role companies have to play in \nthe environmental and social transition. Our portfolio companies are speci\ufb01cally \ndemonstrating how digital solutions can accelerate and amplify sustainable inno-\nvations to produce a common good. Whether or not they may all be \u201cimpact by \ndesign\u201d, a large proportion of them are reinventing economic and social models \nrelated to healthcare, housing, mobility, nutrition or business practices.

White Star Capital incorporates ESG issues \ninto investment analysis and decision ma-\nking processes by:\n -\nAssessing \npotential \ntarget \ninvestments \nagainst relevant ESG criteria\n -\nA thorough due diligence investigation and \ninherent ESG risk analysis\n -\nThe inclusion of ESG \ufb01ndings collected du-\nring due diligence in the investment commit-\ntee memo and if identi\ufb01ed ESG risks cannot \nbe mitigated, no investment shall be made\n2.  White Star Capital is an active investor \nand incorporates ESG issues into ownership \npractices by:\n -\nSharing ESG objectives, policies and prac-\ntices with portfolio companies\n -\nSupporting portfolio companies\u2019 efforts in \nimproving their ESG performance\n -\nActively engaging with portfolio companies \nand offering support to help them reach and \nsurpass ESG compliance effort\n3. White Star Capital seeks appropriate disclo-\nsures on ESG issues by our portfolio compa-\nnies by: \n -\nRequiring reporting on ESG issues hi-\nghlighted in the due diligence process \n -\nAsking for information from companies re-\ngarding adoption of/adherence to relevant \nnorms, standards, codes of conduct or inter-\nnational initiatives\n -\nSupporting shareholder initiatives and reso-\nlutions promoting ESG compliance \n4. White Star Capital promotes acceptance \nand implementation of the principles within \nthe investment industry by: \n -\nCommunicating ESG expectations to service \nproviders and will reassess relationships \nwith providers that do not adhere to ESG \nguidelines \n -\nAligning investment mandates, monitoring \nprocedures and performance indicators \nWhite Star Capital believes in the opportunity for value creation generated by actively providing \nguidance and monitoring portfolio companies\u2019 commitment to ESG factors.

Of note, we identified approximately 140 suppliers in \nscope for our responsible sourcing program, established \ncriteria for measuring progress and enlisted a technology \npartner to assess supplier performance.\u202fWe also achieved \nthe 10-year goal we set in 2012 to transition our pork \nsupply chain in the U.S. and Canada away from sow \ngestation stalls in favor of open pen or group housing for \nconfirmed pregnant sows. \nFrom our executive leaders to the crew in each restaurant, we \nhave set high goals for our People, who continue to rise to the \noccasion. We are building more pathways aimed at increasing \nthe diversity of representation across our restaurant support \nstaff, Company restaurant teams and franchise community. We \nalso unlocked opportunities to increase franchise ownership \namong diverse candidates by launching a new recruiting initiative, \nOwn Your Opportunity, which is creating opportunities to \nfranchise ownership for all, increasing our total franchise base by \napproximately 10%.

It documents the company\u2019s energy \nuse, water, pollution, natural resources,  \nconservation, animal treatment and  \nbenefits to the environment. \nInvestors are requesting information on the commitment to the three ESG \npillars. In coming years their request could be a requirement.  Historically,  \nthe industry has done a poor job showcasing its community benevolence.   \nAn ESG minded company attracts more investment and channels a  \npositive message to shareholders.  The environmental, social and gov-\nernance standards have become the leading indictors of measuring \nmanagement competence, risk management, and financial perfor-\nmance. \nA Sustainable, Responsible, Impact (SRI) investment strategy is based on \nthe belief that a commitment to the principals of Corporate Social Respon-\nsibility (CSR) generated long-term competitive financial returns as well as \npositively impacts society.  For investors and lenders, reducing the risk \nassociated with sustainability of performance is immensely important. \nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) goes beyond the law.  It is about \nself-regulation and reveals itself in a company\u2019s guiding principles,  \noperating philosophy and behaviors toward all stakeholders.  The goal is to \nensure a company\u2019s actions positively impact all stakeholders.  CSR  \nincludes programs, policies and practices related to employees, suppliers, \ncustomers and society. \nThe return on investment for CSR is the positive impact a focus on  \nstakeholders can have on the retention, loyalty and recruitment of employ-\nees and customers, due to reducing the costs associated with employees \nand customer turnover on bottom line performance. \nSustainable, Responsible and Impact Investing is an actual  \ninvestment strategy where ESG and CSR come into play. \nSustainable, Responsible and Impact (SRI) criteria are used to make  \ninvestment decisions.  SRI refers to evaluating the long-term sustainability \nof a company\u2019s performance due to the evolving importance of good  \ncorporate citizenship on business drivers such as reputation, employment, \npurchasing decisions and more. \nIn our ever changing society, transparency on the issues of environment, \nsocial responsibility and corporate leadership are becoming more  \nimportant.  Investors are turning their backs on companies that don\u2019t offer \ninformation on these areas.  There is a need to \u201ctell our story\u201d to compete \nin the investment world.   \nGovernance \nGovernance information in an ESG document \nlooks at a company\u2019s leadership, executive \npay, audits, internal controls and shareholder \nrights. \nToday financial results are not the only measure by which \nfirms are valued on the market.  Social and environmental \noutcomes of a company are critical to the sustainability of \ncompany growth. \n\n Is an Environmental, Social and Governance document \n a new operational requirement? \nNo. ESG reporting is voluntary.  However, the oil and gas industry is \nchanging and a clear indication is the performance of oil and gas  \ncompanies on the S&P 500.  Most brokerage firms and mutual funds  \ninvest in companies that follow ESG criteria.  \nWhat constitutes an acceptable set of ESG criteria? \nIt\u2019s subjective.  Investors must do the research to find companies that \nmatch their own values. \nIs there a template ESG or a sample to follow? \nVisit the DEPA website for more information about how to get started \ncreating an ESG report, and to find links to sample ESG reports as well as \nthe Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co \u201cData Disclosure Wish List\u201d for Domestic \nUS E&P.   \nVisit the DEPA website for more information about how to get started \ncreating an ESG report, and to find links to sample ESG reports and the \nTudor, Pickering, Holt & Co \u201cData Disclosure Wish List\u201d for Domestic US \nE&P companies.   \nHow Do I Start? \nESG should be addressed in \nevery oil and gas company\u2019s \nmission statement going  \nforward. \nCompanies should communicate their \nESG analysis and plans to shareholders \nand the community at large.

Our investment teams are the change agents who \ncan impact companies to manage risks and opportunities.\nThe aim of our Active Ownership Report covering three parts \u2018Engagements\u2019, \u2018Collaborative Engagements\u2019 and \u2018Voting\u2019 is to \nprovide our customers and stakeholders with regular updates on our progress and results.\nActive Ownership Report\nThe 3 parts of the report\nPart 1: \nEngagements\nPart 2: \nVoting\nPart 3: \nCollaborative \nEngagements\n\n3\nWhere to get additional information\nResponsible Investment Policy\nclick here\nActive Ownership Instruction\nclick here\nVoting Guidelines\nclick here\nInvestment Restrictions\nclick here\nPrincipal Adverse Impact Statement\nclick here\nProxy Voting Dashboard\nclick here\nOur Responsible Investment Journey\nclick here\nInvestment Approach on Climate\nclick here\nProxy Voting Dashboard\nclick here\n\nActive Ownership Report, Part 1 \nEngagements\nThis presentation is intended to be used as marketing material as defined by the European Directive 2014/65/EU dated 15 May 2014 (MiFID II) in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, \nLuxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\n5\nEngagements introduction\nWe believe that investment manager-driven dialogue with portfolio \ncompanies is the most effective as the investment teams are the experts of \ntheir respective strategies and portfolios, and tasked with the buy/sell \ndecision. \nAs such, the investment teams engage on a regular basis with investee \ncompanies on material ESG matters in order to enhance and protect the \nvalue of the investments. \nIn order to ensure a structured engagement process, we log and monitor \ncompany dialogue and progress.\n\n6\nIn 2021, we have had the following engagement activities\nInteractions\n1420\nCountry domiciles\n49\nCompanies\n938\nEngagement subjects\n104\n\n7\n57\n56\n53\n49\n45\n45\n33\n28\n27\n25\nPharmaceuticals (Consumer, Non-cyclical)\nBanks (Financial)\nRetail (Consumer, Cyclical)\nChemicals (Basic Materials)\nSoftware (Technology)\nFood (Consumer, Non-cyclical)\nCommercial Services (Consumer, Non-cyclical)\nOil&Gas (Energy)\nHealthcare-Products (Consumer, Non-cyclical)\nReal Estate (Financial)\nTop 10 industries most engaged with \nNumber of companies per industry (Sector in bracket)\nNote: The Bloomberg Industry Classification Systems (BICS) is used for sector classification\nCompanies\n938\n\n8\nEngagement with companies domiciled across the world\nCountry domiciles\n49\n\n9\nSplit between engagement subjects\nEnvironmental\n44%\nSocial\n23%\nGovernance\n33%\nE\nS\nG\nEngagement subjects\n104\n\n10\nSplit between engagement themes across regions\nNordics\n47%\n21%\n32%\nEastern Europe\n56%\n11%\n33%\nWestern & Southern Europe\n47%\n25%\n28%\nRest of the world\n35%\n27%\n38%\nE\nS\nG\nEngagement subjects\n104\n\n11\nEngagements subjects discussed\nE\nS\nG\nAccounting\nAML Issues & Handling\nAnti-Corruption Issues & Handling\nAnti-Trust Issues & Competitive Behavior\nBoard Compensation\nBoard Composition\nBond redemption\nBusiness Ethics\nCapital Structure\nCompetence\nCompliance Procedures\nCorporate Behavior\nCorporate Disclosure\nCorporate Governance\nCorporate purpose\nCritical Incident Risk Management\nData Privacy\nDigitalisation As Sustainability Driver\nDividends\nESG Funding\nESG Integration\nExecutive Compensation\nExecutive Composition\nFuture Fit\nGender Equality\nImpact of Tax Regulation\nIncentive Programs\nM&A\nManagement of The Legal & Regulatory Environment\nMaterials Sourcing & Efficiency\nMilitary Sales Process\nOverboarding\nOwnership Structure\nPolitical Risk\nProfit Warning\nQuality Management\nRegulations\nRegulatory Compliance\nResearch & Development\nRestructuring\nShare Buybacks\nSustainability Integration & Reporting\nSustainability Strategy\nSustainability Targets\nSystemic Risk Management\nTax Issues\nTechnology Disruption\nAccess & Affordability\nAnimal Welfare\nAutomation\nBusiness Model Resilience\nCircular Economy\nCustomer Education\nCustomer Privacy\nCustomer Welfare\nData Security\nDecent Work & Economic Growth\nDigitalisation\nEmployee Engagement, Diversity & Inclusion\nEmployee Health & Safet", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Stating this commitment is admirable, but \nputting those words into action is what\u2019s important if \nwe wish to enact real change.\nIn fiscal year 2022, Adient did just that, undertaking \nmany initiatives that continued to further our ESG \njourney. This included the publication of three important \ndocuments: Adient\u2019s Deforestation Policy, Human Rights \nPolicy Statement and DE&I Commitment Statement. \nThe Deforestation Policy reiterates our commitment to \nprocuring forest commodities from more sustainable \nsources to reduce our potential impact on deforestation \nand climate change. Our Human Rights Policy provides \nan overview of our priorities and commitments in the \narea of human rights, and our DE&I Commitment \nStatement recognizes the importance of diversity in \nenhancing our culture and business performance.\nIn addition, we have taken concrete steps to enact \nchange though alliances such as our agreement with H2 \nGreen Steel to supply fossil-free steel with a low carbon \nfootprint from 2026 on for use in Adient\u2019s world-class \nmetals products.\nOn the product front, our engineers and designers \ncontinue to focus on developing more sustainable \nproducts, such as Adient\u2019s UltraThin\u2122 seat, recently \nrecognized with a Future of Lightweighting award at \nthe 2022 Altair Enlighten Awards. This sustainable \nseat technology does not exist anywhere else in the \nautomotive industry. \nWe have established three regional DE&I Councils as \nwell as nearly two dozen employee-run business resource \ngroups (BRGs) globally that further our grassroots efforts \nin diversity, equity and inclusion. These BRGs focus on \nprofessional development, community outreach and \neducation to create an inclusive culture. In addition, \nwe leverage our high-potential employee development \nprogram, Adient Accelerate, to tackle key business \nchallenges through action-learning projects. In fiscal \nyear 2022, three of these projects were aligned to ESG \ntopics \u2014 Renewable Energy, New Start Electrical Vehicle \nBusiness Strategy and Employee Development (Social \nSustainability).\nAll these efforts are significant steps in our continuing \nESG journey. They demonstrate that Adient has firmly \nintegrated sustainability into the core of our business to \nbecome the foremost sustainable automotive seating \nsupplier. We have dedicated talent, technology and \nsustainable processes globally to enrich our sustainability \nprogram. We have implemented robust policies and \nprocedures to enhance our ESG governance structure \nand responsibilities. Additionally, we have improved our \nability to gather quality data to track our progress in a \nsystematic and reliable manner. \nAdient continues to receive support from our Board of \nDirectors, leadership team and managers to drive our \nsuccess at all levels of the organization and within our \nsupply base. \nI join the entire global Adient team in sharing this year\u2019s \naccomplishments and goals in our 2022 Sustainability \nReport as we continue to do our part to lessen our \nenvironmental impact on the world and create a more \nsustainable future.\nDoug Del Grosso\nAdient President and CEO \nESG at Adient\nAppendix\nProtecting\nthe Environment\nPeople and\nCommunities\nGovernance and\nCompliance\nTable of Contents\n2022 Sustainability Report  |  4\n\nCompany Overview\nAt Adient, we are always innovating and continually improvi", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "The role of  \ncoil coatings \nin building a \nsustainable \nenvironment\n\nRegulatory landscape\nIn its 2021 report (AR6), The Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC \u2013 the UN\u2019s \nbody for assessing the science related to \nclimate change) stated that human activity \nhas without doubt warmed the atmosphere, \nocean and land, resulting in unprecedented \nchanges to our planet. It warned that unless \nthere is a significant reduction in CO2 and \nother greenhouse emissions soon, the global \ntemperature will rise by 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) \nand lead to more extreme weather. The \nreport indicated that these conditions would \nhave dramatic adverse consequences for \nboth human society and the wider planetary \necosystem. The IPCC also reported that this \ncan be avoided through a concerted joint  \neffort by humanity, particularly industry,  \nto reduce greenhouse emissions.\nIn response, around the world, ESG \nreporting standards are becoming more \nstandardized and mandatory. In Europe for \nexample, the introduction of the corporate \nsustainability reporting directive (CSRD) has \nbeen introduced. By 2025, over 50,000 \norganizations, including 4,000 non-EU \norganizations with large EU operations,  \nmust report and comply with the new  \nESG standards. Their sustainability data  \nacross the entire business value chain can, \nsubject to materiality, include CO2 emissions, \nwaste reduction, and the use of hazardous  \nraw materials classified as substances of \nconcern (SoC). \nIn other regions, countries such as the US, \nHong Kong, and Singapore currently have \ncomply-or-explain policies. Additionally, \nthe IFRS (International Financial Reporting \nStandards) Foundation has established the \nInternational Sustainability Standards Board  \nto develop an ESG reporting framework  \nwhich is likely to be adopted alongside its \nexisting standards in 144 countries. \nTo meet these new regulations at home \nand abroad, companies will have to choose \nbetter practices and processes to reduce \ntheir own environmental impact and review \nthe environmental footprint of their upstream \nsuppliers and downstream customers. \nThere will also be a rising expectation of \nsuppliers to inform their customers of less \nharmful solutions and guide them towards \nmore sustainable products and business \npractices, there is a growing need to explore \na path to achieving a more sustainable built \nenvironment without sacrificing performance\nGovernmental bodies around the world are increasing regulation to push the industry towards achieving net \nzero by 2050. Many companies in the construction industry, including architects and specifiers, now face \nthe challenge of managing and measuring their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance \nso that they can provide regulators, customers and suppliers with crucial data. \nThese companies also face the added complexity of key raw \nmaterials used in coil coatings being re-classified due to their negative \nenvironmental and societal impact. Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), \nsuch as PVDF and PVF fluoro-polymers, which coat roofs and metal \ncomponents of buildings, may be partially or completely banned in  \nsome areas within a few years so alternatives will need to be adopted. \nThere are many challenges to producers and consumers of metal \nbuilding materials and acting as a good global citizen is no longer simply \na competitive advantage for any organization; it is a business imperative \nthat will ultimately decide who wins and who loses in business. \nThis document aims to increase these stakeholders\u2019 understanding of \nthe current changes, the reasons for the change and what action can  \nbe taken to remain compliant and competitive. \n2\nIntroduction\n\n3\nReporting and reducing \nCO2 emissions\nCompanies will need to report the annual \nreductions in carbon emissions based on \ncarbon footprint calculations from cradle \nto grave and cradle to gate. Suppliers \nwill need to provide their customers with \nemission data for all products sold. \nCoatings suppliers like AkzoNobel can \nprovide coil and extrusion manufacturers \nwith the carbon and emissions data \nfor their coatings. Coil and extrusion \nmanufacturers can then use these in \nreporting their Scope 3 emissions and \nshare with architects, suppliers, and \nconstruction companies when asked. \nFig. 1 \u2013 An illustration of the emissions reporting data AkzoNobel collects, \nreports, and provides its customers \nOne tool used to understand the climate change impact of a product or product \nfamily is a Life Cycle Assessment. It provides an estimate of the expected  \ngreenhouse gas contribution as well as other environmental impacts like ecotoxicity. \nIn 2019, CEPE (the European Council of the Paint, Printing Ink, and Artists' Colours \nIndustry) published a life cycle assessment for 1 square meter of coated steel \ncladding. Figure 2 shows the amount of CO2 equivalents generated during its \nmanufacture. What becomes clear is that 90% of CO2 emissions result from steel \nproduction (c", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

With these as its base, Alfa Laval aims to help \nenhance the productivity and competitiveness of its \ncustomers in various industries throughout the world. \nWe de\ufb01ne their challenges and deliver sustainable products \nand solutions that meet their requirements \u2013 mainly in \nenergy, the environment, food and the marine industry.\nAlfa Laval\n\nAlfa Laval is helping to achieve 15 of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development \nGoals through products and solutions that improve energy efficiency, \nreduce emissions, purify water, minimize waste and lead to the efficient \nuse of raw materials.\nOperations handles production-related procurement, distribution and logistics on \na global basis and ensures that anything sold by the three divisions is produced \nand delivered in line with the promise made to the customer.\nThe need to heat, cool, transport and separate arises in many industries: \nfood, energy, pharmaceuticals, refineries or petrochemicals \u2013 Alfa Laval can \nhelp in the majority of them. End customers are reached through the Energy, \nFood & Water and Marine divisions.\nFor whom?\nWhere?\nSustainability?\nHow?\nAlfa Laval\u2019s products, systems and services are sold in more than 100 countries. \nMore than 110 service centers deliver services in over 160 countries This means \nthat Alfa Laval is close to its customers, ready to help at a moment\u2019s notice\nwhen the need arises.\nHeat transfer\nCompact heat exchangers that recycle heat, optimize customers\u2019 energy \nconsumption, cut costs and reduce negative environmental impact.\nSeparation\nSeparators, decanter centrifuges, filters, strainers and membranes that separate \nliquids from other liquids and solid particles from liquids or gases.\nFluid handling\nPumps, valves, tank cleaning equipment and installation material for industries \nwith stringent hygiene requirements as well as pumping systems specifically \nfor the marine industry and the offshore market.\nWhat?\n\n5\nTwo renewable sources of energy that bring hope of a brighter future. They reduce the carbon \nfootprint dramatically and are expected to account for half the world\u2019s electricity generation in \nten years\u2019 time. There is only one big problem: when the sun is not shining and the wind does \nnot blow, no power is generated. Unless the energy can be stored effectively on a large scale. \nAs part-owner of a new company, Alfa Laval\u2019s knowledge and expertise is playing an important\nrole in turning this challenge into reality.\nOur unique and specially designed heat exchangers convert electrical energy from solar and wind \nplants into thermal energy. The heat is then stored and preserved in gigantic bays of molten salt \n\u2013 like a natural battery \u2013 waiting to be awakened and transformed back into electricity when \nneeded in the grid. So, even on grey days, the forecast looks bright.\nSolar and wind\n\n6\nAlfa Laval performed well in 2020 and we remain fully committed \nto our long-term strategy while leveraging the changing market \nconditions.

Thanks to the tremendous effort \nand commitment of our employees, working together as one Alpha Trains team, we \nhave achieved great results.\nWe have every reason to be proud and I would like to thank everyone for their contri-\nbution, commitment and courage in this challenging year.\nWe have assessed the challenges described above as having little impact on our \nbusiness, and in some areas even a positive impact.\nFor example, vehicle utilisation is a key measure of our financial performance, and \nthis year we achieved record levels in our locomotive division, complemented by \n100% utilisation in our passenger division. In fact, for seven months in 2022 we \nachieved 100% utilisation across the Group (locomotives and passenger trains). \nThese are remarkable milestones and a testament to our people who ensure that \nwe deliver the right vehicles, at the right time, under the right conditions, to our \ngrowing customer base.\n2022 \u2013 OUR JOURNEY TO GREATER SUSTAINABILITY\nDespite the challenges of 2022, we have maintained our focus on sustainability.\nHere are just some of our achievements:\nNew LEED-certified office in Cologne\nIn February, Alpha Trains moved into its new sustainable office in Cologne. Built to \nthe latest energy and environmental design guidelines and awarded a LEED (Leader-\nship in Energy and Environmental Design) certificate, the office meets the company\u2019s \nhigh standards for sustainability.\nUN Global Signatory and our commitment to the SDGs\nAlpha Trains has been a signatory of the UN Global Compact for two years and is \ncommitted to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nSuccessful ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 recertification\nIn October 2022, Alpha Trains successfully passed the annual external audit for ISO \n14001 and ISO 45001. The auditors from T\u00dcV Rheinland Group commented very po-\nsitively on our sustainability strategy and the maturity of our sustainability system.\nGRESB Assessment 2022\nIn October 2022, Alpha Trains demonstrated sustainable leadership at its best and \nachieved a world-class result for Alpha Trains in the GRESB benchmark\n  \u00071st place overall in the GRESB assessment (out of 649 participants worldwide)\n  \u0007Sector Leader in Transport and Sector Leader in Transport/Rail Companies\n  \u0007GRESB 5-star rating for the sixth consecutive year\n  \u0007\u00adMaximum possible score of 100 out of 100\nA result we are very proud of.\n\nNew Green Finance Framework\nIn December 2022, Alpha Trains refinances existing debt and secures growth finan-\ncing, adding a total of \u20ac548 million to its green loan base. The new Green Finance \nFramework is aligned with the latest Green Bond & Green Loan Principles and the EU \ntaxonomy.\nContinued carbon neutrality\nIn December 2022, Alpha Trains continued its journey as a sustainable locomotive \nand train rental company in continental Europe to become carbon neutral, underli-\nning the rental company\u2019s strong commitment to sustainability.\nSocial initiatives\nAlso in December 2022, Alpha Trains continued to support local charity initiatives. \nInstead of Christmas gifts for customers, we have decided to donate the money to \nthree local charity projects.\nAlpha Trains receives EcoVadis Gold Medal\nWe are delighted to announce that we have been awarded the \u201cEcoVadis Gold\u201d \naward, placing us in the top 5% of sustainable companies assessed by EcoVadis \nworldwide.\nAnd a few more achievements in key words\n  Flexible work from home policy\n  Free public transport passes for our Cologne employees\n  Our e-bike leasing scheme for all employees\n  Improved car policy to promote electric and hybrid company cars\n  \u0007Ongoing HSE awareness, regular training and consistent tracking of regular \ninspections.\n2023 \u2013 OUR NEXT STEPS\nWe are convinced and excited by the incredible potential of \nmodal shift to rail as a lever to reduce the overall environmen-\ntal impact of transport. We will therefore continue to seize the \nopportunities it offers to improve the sustainability of a modern \nsociety.\nAs a company, we aim to maintain and expand our \nrole as a ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Wongtrakool, Michael Borowske and Florent Vallespir\nOnce the Disruptor, Now the Disrupted\nCommercialization of the automobile in the early 1900s transformed livelihoods and living standards across the \nindustrialized world. As the automobile industry developed, millions of manufacturing and assembly jobs were \ncreated, petroleum and steel companies grew significantly, and train usage fell sharply. When passenger cars \nbecame commonplace, larger homes were built in the suburbs, tourism activity increased, and the movie drive-in \nand fast food drive-thru industries were born.\nThough cars remain well entrenched in modern lifestyles, in more recent years the automotive industry has been \nthe subject, rather than catalyst, of change. In early 2007, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Tier I/\nII suppliers were challenged by leveraged balance sheets, expensive cost structures and large pension liabilities. \nGiven the highly cyclical nature of demand for automotive products, the Great Financial Crisis dealt a particularly \ndamaging blow to the industry, so much that executives from the Detroit Three and United Auto Workers (UAW) \nleadership were forced to seek emergency funding from the US government to avoid bankruptcy. \nBetween 2009 and 2017, the industry benefited from very low unemployment levels, favorable financing terms \nand solid residual values. Global sales and production volumes rebounded, resulting in improved margins, record \nprofitability and healthier balance sheets. Since then, however, a new set of challenges has emerged, including \nseveral major environmentally and socially driven shifts in demand. These secular trends, which will play out over \nmultiple years, include electrification, autonomous driving and shared mobility. \nIn this piece, we will take an in-depth look at these disruptive changes. We will explore their implications on the \nautomotive workforce and on society, and the governance and strategy required to navigate them. To conclude, \nwe will review how these environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors have shaped our investment outlook \nand positioning in the automotive sector.\nElectrification: Between a Rock and a Hard Place\nTransportation is estimated to account for 15% to 25% of global carbon emissions, with road vehicles responsi-\nble for almost three-quarters of that share.1 Given that almost 200 countries have committed to reducing their \nemissions under the Paris Agreement, there is no doubt that the usage of electric vehicles (EVs) must increase \naround the world. \nThe path to achieving this, however, is clouded by supply and demand-related concerns.

Addressing these challenges \nis an ongoing process, one that requires concerted effort from all \nstakeholders.\nCyber security and privacy protection are Huawei\u2019s top priorities, \ncommitments that are above and beyond any commercial interests. \nWe continue to maintain a solid track record in cyber security, and \n\nour efforts have earned widespread recognition in over 170 markets \naround the world, where we serve more than three billion people. \nCustomer trust is the most solid testament to the security and quality \nof Huawei\u2019s products and services.\nOn the industry front, Huawei firmly believes that openness and \ncollaboration lead to shared success. We actively engage with the ICT \nindustry, working with our peers and industry stakeholders to share \nbest practices in cyber security and privacy protection. In 2022, we \nsubmitted nearly 300 cyber security standards proposals to 3GPP and \nGSMA. Working side-by-side with stakeholders all along the value \nchain, we are innovating together to bolster the industry\u2019s cyber \nsecurity and privacy protection capabilities. Together, we are building \na more secure digital world.\nTogether, we are cultivating digital talent to bridge the digital \ndivide. Digital talent plays an instrumental role in driving digital \ntransformation and unleashing digital productivity.

Introduction \nMessage from Chairman of the Executive Committee \nIt is my pleasure to present to you this ESG report, which outlines our company's \ncommitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Here at ARICOMA, \nwe believe that conducting business in a responsible and sustainable manner is not only \nthe right thing to do but is also essential for long-term success. \nIn this report, we highlight our efforts to minimise our impact on the environment, \npromote social well-being, and uphold high standards of corporate governance. We \nrecognise that our actions as a company can have a significant impact on the world \naround us, and we take our responsibilities seriously. \nOur company is pursuing the target of reducing emissions per employee by 20% over the \nnext 5 years. As a result, we are also going to significantly decrease our energy \nconsumption, which will have a positive impact not only on our cost base, but also on the \nenvironment. \nIn general, our ESG initiatives include reducing our carbon footprint, informal support of \ndiversity and inclusion, promoting employee health and safety, and ensuring transparent \nand ethical business practices. We strive to engage with our stakeholders and listen to \ntheir concerns, so that we can continue to improve and make a positive impact in the \ncommunities where we operate. \nWe also consider it a particularly important part of our ESG initiative to support various \nnon-profit organisations or culture as such, being a proud partner National Theatre, \nMemory of Nations organisation, etc. \nWe understand that ESG factors are increasingly important to investors, customers, \nemployees, and other stakeholders, and we are committed to integrating these \nconsiderations into our decision-making processes. By doing so, we aim to create value \nfor all our stakeholders and contribute to a more sustainable future. \nThank you for taking the time to read this report, and we welcome your feedback and \nsuggestions as we continue to pursue our ESG goals. \nIf \nyou \nwish \nto \nshare \nyour \nfeedback \nwith \nus, \nplease \ncontact \nus \nat \nsustainability@aricoma.com. \nMilan Same\u0161 \nChairman of the Executive Committee \nARICOMA Group \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nCompany profile \nARICOMA Group is a European information technology company that combines the \ncapabilities of its individual group companies to provide customers with high-quality \nindividualised and complex solutions that help them to achieve their goals.  \nFounded in 2017 with a vision of becoming a major European IT services player, ARICOMA \nGroup offers IT services, via its member companies, to corporate and government clients, \nincluding application and software development, integration and implementation of IT \nsystems, managed services, data centres, hardware sale, cyber security services and \ncloud services. \nWith its headquarters i", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

This created a highly \ninflationary and volatile environment for \nboth company and farmers. \nThanks to strong execution by employ-\nees and management, Arla once again \nproved agile in navigating these difficult \nconditions. Coupled with a decline in \nglobal milk production which drove \ncommodity prices upwards, this enabled \na higher return to our farmer owners.  \nThe average prepaid milk price in 2022 \nwas 52.0 EUR-cent/kg, 40.5 per cent \nhigher than the previous year.

In August 2022, \nwe delivered on that commitment in a new way by organizing \nan unprecedented event in our company\u2019s history. \u201cONE Atea\u201d \nbrought together all our employees at a special event here in \nOslo, with our sustainability plans high on the agenda. In doing \nso, we made a compelling case that Atea is truly The Place \nto Be!\nThat spirit of unity helped guide us throughout 2022, as we \ncontinued to develop our programs in sustainability-infused \ncorporate performance. \nFor instance, Atea once again earned a top ranking by \nCorporate Knights\u201449th place globally\u2014as well as a top \n1% ranking by EcoVadis. We also earned a Leadership \nBand placement among global companies analyzed by the \nCDP, a non-profit organization that runs the world\u2019s leading \nenvironmental disclosure platform. This marks a new personal \nbest for our company since first reporting to CDP over ten \nyears ago. And we achieved a new record with our Goitloop \nconcept. Today, it\u2019s one of the largest reuse-and-recycle \nprograms in Northern Europe. You can read more details about \neach of these achievements (among others) in this report. \nWe remain united in the face of events here in Europe, \nproviding humanitarian support and relief to Ukraine and its \ncitizens, standing shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors \nagainst unlawful aggression.\nIn times of uncertainty\u2014colored by inflation, pandemic \nrecovery and other challenging events\u2014united is how we \npersevere. Atea\u2019s track record is proof. And it\u2019s documented in \nevery page of this year\u2019s sustainability report. \nAs always, thank you for your time in reading this important \ndocument. \n \nSteinar S\u00f8nsteby, \nCEO of Atea ASA\nSteinar S\u00f8nsteby,\nCEO of Atea ASA\nSteinar S\u00f8nsteby joined Atea in 1997 and was \nmanaging director of Atea in Norway in 1997- \n2000 and for Atea in Sweden in ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

While there is still much work to do, and certain prevention protocols \nwill remain for some time, our organization has been reflecting on the last 18 months.\nWe do so with a sense of pride for how we prioritized the health and safety of our associates, and for our \ncontributions as an essential supplier to many of the world\u2019s crucial products and services. We also find value in the \nmany learnings and opportunities that have surfaced, as the experience of the pandemic has shaped behaviors, \npriorities and lifestyles for generations to come.\nAmong them is that the response and recovery effort confirmed something we at Avient have always known\u2014that the \nrole our material science plays in sustainability for the world is more important than ever. Avient answered the call to \ndeliver much needed healthcare supplies, including facemasks, ventilators, test kits, and other PPE. We were there for \nthe food and consumer product supply chain, allowing for long shelf life of perishable goods and for safe handling of \ncleaning and sanitization supplies. For IT infrastructure that enabled the shift to remote work and for high performance \napplications as people of the world adapted lifestyles to more outdoor activities\u2026we were there.\n \nAs the world now seeks the next generation of sustainable solutions\u2026we are also there. From increasing post \nconsumer recycled (PCR) and bio-polymer content, to improving the overall recyclability of plastics, our technology \nteams are proudly collaborating with customers to bring new innovations to market.\nAt the same time, we have continued to invest in the environmental, social and governance priorities that are \nincumbent upon companies today, including actions that address climate change. We have updated performance \nprogress toward our 2030 Sustainability Goals as well as expanded commitments, such as utilizing 100% renewable \nenergy and becoming operationally carbon neutral by 2050. Herein you\u2019ll also find increased reporting and \ntransparency in each of four sustainability cornerstones: People, Products, Planet and Performance.\nThe purpose of our Sustainability Report is not solely ESG compliance and reporting.

Confronted with supply \nchain disruption, and concerned with the \nwellbeing of our global community, we forged \nahead with renewed ambition to do better; \nworking out ways to make our product more \nefficiently, minimising our environmental \nimpact, and taking care of our people at every \nstep of the way. \nMany of the changes we implemented as a \nresult of the pandemic continued to be of \nvalue in 2021. We held on to new traditions of \ndigitally connecting our worldwide workforce. \nOur virtual showroom, originally developed \namid widespread travel restrictions, continued \nto evolve, providing us with an innovative way \nto showcase our designs without the air miles. \nDuring a second year of Covid restrictions, \nwe truly appreciated our collective need \nto make time for creativity and inspiration. \nThis led us to introduce Bally Smart Talks, in \nwhich philosophers, artists, innovators and \nacademics shared their personal experiences \nand thought-provoking ideas with our Bally \nCommunity. \nThe pandemic impacted every area of our \nbusiness, but it hasn\u2019t stopped us from \nmaking sustainability a priority. The climate \ncrisis represents the biggest threat to \nhumanity, and we will never lose sight of this \nhumbling fact. Together with our industry, \nwe are responsible for shaping the future \nof fashion and redefining its purpose. It\u2019s \nencouraging to see our recent 77% score leap \nin the Fashion Transparency Index, published \nby the global movement Fashion Revolution. \nNot only has our commitment to sustainability \nevolved, but our ability to measure and \ndemonstrate our progress has too, with the \ndetail provided in this report growing more \nsophisticated and more meaningful each year. \nSince we drew up our Sustainability Roadmap \nin 2019, we have been committed to providing \nevidence of our actions. In 2021, we mapped \nand published a list of the main Tier 1 and \nTier 2 suppliers active in our supply chain in \n2020. Not only does this improve our level of \ntransparency, it helps us to uncover and plan \nmore sustainable ways of bringing our pieces \nto life in future. \nFor 170 years, we\u2019ve been making products \nthat stand the test of the time, but that\u2019s only \npart of the story today. We\u2019re now re-imagining \nmore responsible ways to bring our designs \ninto being. The 2021 Bally Wilson Echo, a \nsneaker made entirely from materials on our \nrecyclable and sustainable list, is an example \nof such innovation. Building on the success \nCEO Message\n3\nCEO MESSAGE\n\n4\nof our B-Echo collection, we have continued \nto expand our use of regenerated leather, \nrepurposed PET mesh and recycled nylon \nacross the rest of our designs, with Mythos, \nCrew and Explore product lines all made using \nthese more sustainable materials. Meanwhile, \ninitiatives such as our Scribe Renewal \nProgram see iconic Bally designs being \nkept in circulation for longer, upholding our \ntradition of creating longstanding wardrobe \nstaples \u2013 a much-needed antidote to a world \ndominated by disposable fashion. \n \nIn 2021, we also calculated our footprint in \ncompliance with the leading Greenhouse \nGas Protocol Corporate Standard, a complex \nprocess that ultimately classifies our \nemissions into three scopes. This data sets \nthe foundation for science-based target \nsetting in 2023 and will inform our plan for \nthe reduction of CO2 emissions.

For the first time, Barilla pasta goes into orbit with approximately 3 kg of fusilli on board the ISS \n(International Space Station) capsule of Mission Ax-3. Without the addition of preservatives or additives, the \nproduct was treated solely with heat. Seasoned with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt, the pasta was tested and \nevaluated in a series of sensory experiments with the aim of understanding the dietary needs of astronauts in \nzero gravity.\n\n October. Guido Barilla and Alessandro Savelli, Founder & CEO of Pasta Evangelists, at the inauguration of the first Pasta \nEvangelists factory in the United Kingdom, the largest pasta factory in UK history.\n5\n4\nIn 2023, we were faced with a landscape full of uncertainties. The \ninternational scenario, already troubled by the conflict between \nRussia and Ukraine, was further shaken by the outbreak of war in \nthe Middle East. A situation that forced everyone to repeatedly \nrevise every economic forecast, especially due to a sharp increase \nin interest rates and the consequent rise in the costs of raw \nmaterials and energy.\nIn 2023, the Group's total turnover was approximately \u20ac4.9 billion, \nan increase of 4% compared to 2022. The EBITDA margin remained \nconstant at 10%, confirming the previous year's results.\nIn this context, to accelerate the company's international expansion, \nBarilla added the Business Development Centre in Amsterdam \nand continued to invest in the Digital Hub in London, focused on \nnew marketing and sales strategies via digital and e-commerce \nplatforms. All this while always maintaining its cultural and \ntechnological roots in Parma.\nMajor steps in the push towards internationalisation were also \ndemonstrated by the construction and opening of the Pasta \nEvangelists plant in London, now the largest pasta and sauce \nproduction site in the United Kingdom, and the acquisition of the \nbakery company Back to Nature in the USA, where a dedicated new \nteam has been created in Minneapolis.\nThe U.S. market has indeed shown great potential for development, \nfacilitated by the increase in domestic consumption of pasta dishes, \nwhich has enabled us to grow both in terms of volumes and value. \nThis situation differs from those in Italy and Europe, where we \nrecorded a decline in volumes in the pasta sector.\nThe Group's investments in 2023 saw \u20ac230 million directed \ntowards improving quality and safety processes, adopting Industry \n4.0 techniques, and starting work on the new Research and \nDevelopment Centre in Parma, which will guide technological and \nproduct innovation activities carried out in the various countries \nwhere we maintain a presence. These initiatives form part of the \u20ac1 \nbillion investment plan over five years, partly designed to strengthen \nour commitment to sustainability.\nThese and many other concrete actions accompany us on our journey, \nmade possible by all the Barilla People who have contributed to our \ngrowth with constant passion and dedication. \nParma, May 2024\nGuido Barilla\nChairman\u2019s letter\n\n6\nDirectors and officers\nBARILLA HOLDING S.r.l. \nBoard of directors\nChairman\nGuido Maria Barilla\nDeputy chairman\nLuca Barilla\nDirectors\nEmanuela Barilla\n", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "Packaging categories\n\u2022\t Packaging refers to packaging and other products within the foodservice, grocery and retail sectors which are facing legislation or \nconsumer pressure.\n\u2022\t Packaging sales only includes those sales of products that will be ultimately bought or used by consumers. Sales of packaging \nrelated products bought by business customers for non retail purposes are captured as non packaging revenue.\n\u2022\t In future years packaging and products may move between categories and/or may be added or removed (for example, as \nlegislation changes, recyclability improves or if a new line of products is launched).\n\u2022\t We have exercised our judgement to allocate sales to the packaging and non-packaging categories as explained below. There are \ncertain limitations with respect to the accuracy and completeness of the packaging categories as it is not always possible to \nevidence the exact composition of our products across the vast range that we sell. Judgements with respect to allocating \nproducts to categories are taken at a point in time, and both evolving legislation and changes in product composition mean that it \nis likely we will recognise adjustments, both current and retrospective, akin to those we have disclosed below this year as we \ncontinue to enhance the quality of our data. We will continue to disclose such adjustments where they are of significance to year \non year trends in our packaging-related data.\nWe review the categorisation of our products and packaging on a quarterly basis as part of our internal controls process and have \nmade two changes this year.\n\u2022\t Food containers made from Expanded Polystyrene \u2018EPS\u2019 have been moved from category 3 to category 2. Several of the countries \nwhere we operate have announced legislation restricting the use of this material in the takeaway foodservice sector and we are \nactively transitioning customers to alternative materials with no reductions in volume. As these restrictions have not been \napplied consistently across our Group (for example, c.94% of our sales in this product category are in United States of America \nwhere EPS is not widely restricted) and they do not impact the fresh produce sector in some of our markets, we have positioned \nthese sales in \u2018Consumable plastics likely to transition\u2019. \n\u2022\t Baking paper and parchment products have moved from category 4 to category 3. Despite c.99% of the material in the product \nbeing renewable and recyclable, the presence of a silicone coating means these products cannot be widely recycled. As papers of \nthis nature serve a functional purpose and alternatives are not commercially available, we have positioned these sales in \n\u2018Packaging and products with an important purpose\u2019.\nCategory detail and  \nname applied by Bunzl\n#\nDescription\nExample products  \nin category\nCategory detail: \nSingle-use plastic products facing \nrestriction\nBunzl name: \nConsumable plastics facing \nregulation\n1\nThe single-use plastic products most commonly facing restriction \n\u2013 i.e. outright bans or complete restriction on placing into the \nmarket within the majority of the countries in which we operate \n\u2013 this is the category where we expect to see some volume \nreduction and transition may not happen on a like-for-like basis.\nWe have expanded these specific regulations to all business areas \nwhere such products are sold.

This \npolicy should incorporate the \nstandards against which due diligence \nis to be conducted, consistent with the \nstandards set forth in the model \nsupply chain policy in Annex II of \nOECD Due Diligence Guidance.  \n \nNokia has a policy which describes its respective commitment to \nconflict-free sourcing globally, including responsible and conflict-\nfree sourcing through legitimate trade from conflict-affected and \nhigh-risk areas and measures taken to reach that goal (referred to \nherein as the \u201cNokia Responsible Minerals Policy\u201d or the \u201cPolicy\u201d). \nIt also sets out a commitment to identify, assess, mitigate, and \nrespond to risks. \n \nNokia Responsible Minerals Policy (formerly Nokia Conflict \nMinerals Policy) has been communicated to suppliers when first \nreleased and thereafter in conjunction with the annual supply chain \nresponsible minerals sourcing inquiry and related webinars.  \n \nThe Nokia Responsible Minerals Policy is reviewed regularly and is \npublicly available on our website: \n  \nhttps://www.nokia.com/about-us/investors/corporate-\ngovernance/policies/  \n \nStructure internal management \nsystems to support supply chain due \ndiligence.  \n \nIn order to support and oversee the implementation of the Policy, \nNokia has set up a cross-functional Responsible Minerals Working \nGroup that includes members with necessary competence from \nsourcing, ESG, and legal teams.  \n \nThe supply chain inquiry is carried out through the internal \nresponsible minerals sourcing deployment team in cooperation with \n \n1 Columbite-tantalite (coltan) (or its derivative tantalum), cassiterite (or its derivative tin), gold and wolframite (or its derivative tungsten). \n\n \n2 / 20 \n<Public> \n\u00a9 2023 Nokia\n \na global network of sourcing managers, and the results are \nperiodically reviewed with Sourcing and Quality leadership (Supply \nQuality Monthly Business Reviews) and Sustainability Council \n(cross-functional \ncommittee \nfor \nsustainability \ngovernance \ncomposed of group ESG management and senior leaders from \nbusiness units). \n \nEstablish a system of controls and \ntransparency over the mineral supply \nchain. This includes a chain of custody or \na traceability system or the identification \nof upstream actors in the supply chain. \nThis may be implemented through \nparticipation in industry-driven programs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNokia\u2019s system of controls and transparency is a combination of \ninternal activities, work with direct suppliers and reliance on joint \nindustry programs such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (the \n\u201cRMI\u201d). As an RMI member company, Nokia is familiar with the rigor \nand development of the audit protocol that led to the RMI \nResponsible Minerals Assurance Process in accordance with an \ninternationally accepted standard: OECD Due Diligence Guidance \nfor Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected \nand High-Risk Areas, 2nd Edition. Furthermore, the mutual \nrecognition between the RMI Responsible Minerals Assurance \nProcess audit and the Responsible Jewellery Council\u2019s Chain of \nCustody certification and London Bullion Market Association\u2019s \nResponsible Gold Programme establish these programs as \ninternationally \naccepted \nindustry \nstandards. \n \nNokia starts its reasonable country of origin inquiry by a scoping of \nits suppliers, for which the product data management system and \nspend data is used to determine which of the suppliers are relevant \nfor the responsible minerals supply chain inquiry. \nIn order to identify the smelters and refiners in our supply chain and \ncountry of origin data, Nokia conducts a supply c", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}}}}

Moreover, the government-\nmandated lockdowns in most parts of China affected both our facilities and our supply chains in this important \nmarket.\nWith respect to China, only virtual interactions were possible for most of the year. However, we were able to take \nmeasures to minimize the impact of this situation, thanks to the high level of flexibility and dedication demonstrated \nby our local management and employees. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to them.\nThe April 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting was also held virtually for the third time on a statutory basis with \ndedicated channels opened to allow shareholders to ask questions. We will return to a regular in-person Annual \nMeeting format in April 2023.\nGovernance roadshows intensified\nDuring the period under review, we continued to engage in a proactive dialogue with our shareholders and proxy \nadvisors. These discussions were mostly held online and led by our Chairman, who was joined by our Independent \nLead Director, the Chairwoman of our Compensation Committee and our Head of Investor Relations.\nThe feedback and updates we received during these exchanges were very helpful, and centered on topics such as \nBoard recruitment, ESG and compensation. We certainly continue to proactively seek and engage in these dialogues, \nas they provide us with a valuable external perspective and welcome feedback that supports us in our ongoing \ndevelopment.\nBoard refreshment and diversity\nFollowing worldwide searches, we have announced that we are proposing Michelle Wen and Monica de Virgiliis as \nnew members of the Board of Directors at the next Annual Shareholders' Meeting on 19\u00a0April 2023. Furthermore, \nJasmin Staiblin will not stand for re-election due to GF's twelve year-limit on Board tenure, while Riet Cadonau has \ndecided not to stand for re-election for personal reasons.\nMichelle Wen brings a wealth of experience in supply chains in several industries, including the automobile sector, a \nkey market especially for GF\u00a0Casting Solutions. Monica de Virgiliis' long tenure in the semiconductor industry and \npresent responsibilities in the utility business will certainly support GF\u00a0Piping Systems. Both Michelle Wen and \nMonica de Virgiliis would ideally complement our board. The skills of all board members are individually disclosed in \nthis report (see \n). This serves as a basis for ongoing and future searches.\nDiversity\nRisk Management\nThe regular board risk management workshop took place in December 2022. The results of the workshop were \ncompared to management views and reconciled. The Audit Committee deepened its cybersecurity risk analyses and \nmonitored progress as presented by management.\nBoard Strategy Meeting\nWith Innovation as the strategic topic of the year, a two-day seminar was held in September to review GF's \ninnovation roadmap in line with the Strategy 2025.\nThe management also presented this topic to analysts and investors at GF's sixth Capital Market Day. The event \nreceived a very positive feedback. Innovation is a key differentiator for GF. Its link and focus on Sustainability is well \nin line and congruent with GF's strategy.\n298\n\nCorporate Reports 2022\nSustainability well-integrated into GF's activities\nA key management objective is the share of products and services with environmental or social benefits. Thus drives \nboth R&D and sales activities.\nConsequently, GF must also be at the forefront with regards to its environmental journey and the reduction of \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its own facilities. In 2022, GF reached an important milestone in this area: the \nScience Based Target initiative (SBTi) validated the company's science-based targets to reduce GHG emissions along \nits value chain. These targets are fully aligned with the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0 C.\nIn addition, the combined report 2022 will for the first time integrate both financial and sustainability reporting.

They also provide standardised and sanitised \nESG information that can easily integrate into analysis and risk management processes. \nWe have used our proprietary ESG methodology of assessing 600+ KPIs to score 1,000 companies across ~65 \nsectors. This evaluation is based on publicly available information released by the companies through their \nwebsites, exchange filings, annual reports, investor presentations, sustainability reports, etc. It also factors in other \nmaterial ESG information available in the public domain through reliable sources, such as data reported by industry \nassociations, regulators and various government agencies. The assessment is based on quantitative as well as \nqualitative disclosures.  \nSince this is an objective evaluation based on publicly available information, the quality of disclosures provided in \nthe public domain is an important determinant of the ESG score, hence CRISIL also provides a Disclosure score \ncategory across companies we score. This becomes imperative for financial institutions and corporates to \nunderstand the level of transparency in terms of reporting non-financial disclosures. \nWe strongly recommend and encourage all companies under our coverage to report maximum possible ESG-\nrelated information in the public domain. This is in sync with good governance principles and best practices around \ntransparency \u2013 an important pillar of our ESG assessments.  \nEach company under our coverage is monitored on a continuous surveillance basis for ESG material events that \ncould potentially lead to a change in scores. \nScoring framework   \nTo arrive at the overall company ESG score, relevant weights are assigned to E (35%), S (25%) and G (40%) \nattributes, to reflect the relative importance of factors. Governance has been assigned the highest weightage as we \nbelieve that good governance practices are the bed rock to drive environment and social agenda of any company. \nCompanies are scored on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is the highest.  \nIn case of Environment and Social assessments, the final score is a combination of the company and the sector \nscores, where sector scores have a 40% weight in the company\u2019s E score and 25% in its S score. The company E \nscore assesses its material environment parameters in relation to its peers within the sector. The sector E score is \nan indicator of how the sector fares relative to other sectors on various environment issues. This approach allows \nus the flexibility to bring nuanced sector-specific parameters into our assessment, while at the same time retaining \nthe cross-sector comparability of the final scores. \nGiven India\u2019s Net Zero target of 2070, many Indian companies have aligned their sustainability strategies to help \nachieve this target. Transition or Parivartan parameters especially such as climate change policy, net zero targets, \ntrend in emission intensity, use of green/alternate raw materials, green product offerings, investments etc. are \nembedded within CRISIL\u2019s evaluation framework to assess the change in quantitative and qualitative metrics \ntoward achieving these sustainability goals.

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": " \n \n \n \n19 July 2021 \n \nDear AFM chair,  \nAuthorised ESG & Sustainable Investment Funds: improving quality and clarity  \nThe growth of investment funds whose strategy focuses on Environment, Social & Governance (ESG) \nthemes has the potential to contribute meaningfully to addressing climate change and other \nsustainable investment goals. Consumers are placing significant value on ESG-related investment \nopportunities.  \nIt is therefore essential that funds marketed with a sustainability and ESG focus describe their \ninvestment strategies clearly and any assertions made about their goals are reasonable and \nsubstantiated. We have seen numerous applications for authorisation of investment funds with an \nESG or sustainability focus. A number of these have been poorly drafted and have fallen below our \nexpectations. They often contain claims that do not bear scrutiny. Also, we would have expected \nquestions raised at the authorisation stage to have been asked (and addressed) in the product design \nphase.  Such applications are likely to fail to meet the applicable requirements as set out further in \nthe annex to this letter. We expect to see material improvements in future applications. We also \nexpect clear and accurate ongoing disclosures to consumers where funds make ESG-related claims, \nand we want to see funds deliver on their stated objectives and/or strategy. We include in this letter \na set of guiding principles that explains our expectations in this area.  \nBuilding trust in the market \nESG and sustainable investment funds are currently the fastest growing segment of the European \nfunds market, reflecting increasing investor appetite for these investments. Authorised Fund \nManagers (AFMs) have responded to this demand. We have seen a high volume of applications for \nauthorisation of funds with an ESG focus in addition to a number of existing funds amending \nobjectives, demonstrating that the market is evolving quickly. There is now a wide spectrum of ESG \nand sustainable investment funds, reflecting different objectives, investment strategies and \ncharacteristics. We welcome innovation within the ESG and sustainable investment market that offers \nconsumers funds that meet their needs and preferences. Equally, we recognise that innovation and \nthe rapid pace of change present the industry with challenges (such as improving ESG-related data \nand metrics) and that ongoing work is taking place to meet these challenges. \nAgainst this backdrop, we are concerned by the number of poor-quality fund applications we have \nseen and the impact this may have on consumers. This must improve. \nAs the ESG and sustainable investment market grows, we have a role as the regulator to build trust in \nthis segment of the market. We expect firms to play their part in this too; we want them to be putting \nconsumers at the heart of their businesses, offering products and services that are fit for purpose and \nwhich they know represent fair value. Additionally, a well-functioning ESG and sustainable investment \n\nmarket is important for the proper allocation of capital in pursuit of a net zero economy. There are \nserious long-term consequences if the market does not function properly in the face of the global \nchallenge with which we are presented. \nWhere consumers find it difficult to assess whether authorised funds meet their needs and \npreferences (at the point of purchase and on an ongoing basis), there is potential to undermine trust \nand deter consumers from this segment of the market. This in turn could result in a lack of effective \ncompetition between the firms providing ESG or sustainable investment funds. As investor appetite \nfor these investment funds grows, we expect these concerns also to grow.  \nWhat we are seeing \nWe have set out below a number of stylised examples of applications for authorisation of investments \nfunds with an ESG/sustainability focus that have fallen below our expectations:  \n\u2022 \nA proposed passive fund had an ESG-related name that we found misleading as it was looking \nto track an index that did not hold itself out to be ESG-focused. It also had very limited \nexclusions from the index, based on high-level ESG criteria. \n \n\u2022 \nA fund application claimed to have a strategy to invest in companies contributing to \u2018positive \nenvironmental impact\u2019. The fund intended to invest predominantly in companies that, while \nreporting low carbon emissions, would not obviously contribute to the net-zero transition. We \nhad expected to see a measurable non-financial objective alongside the financial objective or \nstrategy with information on how that impact would be measured and monitored.   \n \n\u2022 \nInstances where it was challenging to reconcile the fund\u2019s proposed holdings with statements \nmade setting expectations for consumers. One example was a sustainable investment fund \ncontaining two \u2018high-carbon emissions\u2019 energy companies in its top-10 holdings, without \nproviding obvious context or rationale behind it (", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

This transfer will \nbe completed by (i) transferring relevant assets, rights and obligations to the Acquiring \nCompany in the Demerger and (ii) a merger of the Acquiring Company into Yara Clean \nAmmonia Holding AS immediately after the completion of the Demerger in a triangular \nmerger, where the merger consideration will consist of an increase of the Transferring \nCompany's share capital by increasing the nominal value per share in the Transferring \nCompany (the \"Merger\"). A separate merger plan for the Merger is concluded at the same \ntime as this Demerger Plan. Following the completion of the Merger,  the intention is to \ntransfer the shares in Yara Clean Ammonia Holding AS to Yara Clean Ammonia AS, \ncompany registration no 928 652 920, in order to complete the carve-out of the YCA \nBusiness, with Yara Clean Ammonia AS as the ultimate holding company and direct \nsubsidiary of Yara International ASA.  \n1.4 \nTo enable Yara Clean Ammonia Holding AS and its subsidiaries to continue its existing \nbusiness activities following the transfer of the YCA Business, the Transferring Company \nand relevant Yara Clean Ammonia entities have entered into agreements regarding the \nprovision of services by the Yara group to the Yara Clean Ammonia group. \n1.5 \nThe Demerger and the Merger will in accordance with Oslo Stock Exchange's rules be \ncompleted outside the op", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

These circumstances have made us, as a major energy business operator, even more \naware of our mandate, namely to \u201cnever ever stop the energy supply.\u201d We have made every effort to ensure a stable \nsupply of gas and electricity. At this time of a national crisis, Tokyo Gas has served its customers as faithfully and reli-\nably as in the past.\nThe world is steadily moving toward a more sustainable society, despite being shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIn particular, the trend toward decarbonization is accelerating, and since Prime Minister Suga declared in October 2020 \nthat Japan aims at becoming carbon neutral, widespread efforts to achieve decarbonization have begun and are gain-\ning momentum. This trend can be said to be a paradigm shift that will significantly change the economy and society. It \nis incumbent on Tokyo Gas to be alert to this and act accordingly.  \nIn November 2019, Tokyo Gas announced in its statement of its future management vision, Compass 2030, a goal \nof \u201ctaking leadership in the effort to achieve Net-Zero CO2 emissions\u201d as one of the company\u2019s management issues \nand has started to take up this challenge.\nReducing CO2 emissions during transition to Net-Zero CO2\nWe foresee several stages before reaching Net-Zero CO2. We are now in a transition period toward full energy transi-\ntion and decarbonization, during which an emphasis is assigned to the reduction of CO2 emissions. This is just a \nbeginning; we know it will be a long haul on the road to decarbonization. That journey will require innovation and large-\nscale investment extending across diverse areas and over a long time. In the near term, our emphasis is on reduction \nof CO2 emissions, and of the amount of CO2 stored in the atmosphere. Tokyo Gas considers the transition period to \nlast to around 2030, and is working on the following initiatives.\nThe first is the advanced use of natural gas. For example, we anticipate use of energy in urban redevelopment areas \nand industrial parks will be advanced by adopting smart energy network technology. We also introduce high-efficiency \ngas equipment, such as our residential-use fuel cell ENE-FARM and promote replacement of industrial fuels from heavy \noil and coal with natural gas. By doing so, our customers will be able to significantly reduce CO2 emissions.\nThe second initiative is the separation and recovery of CO2. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) and carbon \ndioxide capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), which separate, collect, and bury deep in the ground or reuse emitted \nCO2, can effectively reduce CO2 emissions without them being directly dispersed in the air.\nThe third is the expanded use of carbon neutral LNG (CNL). Inevitably, the process from the extraction of natural \ngas to its burning generates greenhouse gases, but they will be offset by CO2 emissions reduction through support of \nreforestation and other renewable projects. In March 2021, the Tokyo Gas Group established the Carbon Neutral LNG \nBuyers Alliance with 14 other companies with the aim of advancing toward a sustainable society by this third initiative. \nSpecifically, Tokyo Gas will procure and supply CNL and the Alliance companies will purchase and use it as fuel for \noffice building", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "SUSTAINABILITY\nOUR APPROACH TO Sustainability \neasyJet aims to be a responsible and sustainable business. We recognise the \nneed to transition to a low-carbon economy and will continue to work towards \nensuring aviation plays its part. Our focus is to pioneer positive change for our \nplanet, communities and people, getting one step closer to net zero every day. \nThe benefits of aviation are fantastic \u2013 it \nconnects people, reunites friends and \nfamilies, enables people to experience \ndifferent cultures and provides economic \nprosperity. But at the same time, we know \nthat we have a responsibility to minimise \nthe impact of our flights on the planet and \neveryone at easyJet, including myself, \ntakes this responsibility seriously. \nThere is no doubt that decarbonising \naviation is a cross-industry effort and no \none airline can do this alone, however I\u2019m \nincredibly proud of the progress that we, \nand our partners, have made this year and \nbelieve that easyJet is an industry leader on \nits journey to net zero. \nMuch has been achieved this year; in \nNovember 2021, we made an important \ncommitment by joining Race to Zero, a \nUN-backed global campaign to achieve net \nzero carbon emissions by 2050. This was \nclosely followed by setting a carbon \nemissions intensity reduction target of 35% \nby 2035 and in September 2022 we were \nthe first low-cost airline worldwide to \nannounce an interim target validated by \nthe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). \nLater in September we published our \nSBTi-aligned roadmap to achieving net \nzero carbon emissions by 2050. I firmly \nbelieve that our roadmap is the most \nambitious to date due to the focus on new \ntechnology, as soon as available, with the \nambition to achieve zero carbon emission \nflying across our entire fleet in the \nlong-term. By 2050, we plan to have \nreduced our carbon emissions per \npassenger by 78%, with residual emissions \nremoved through carbon capture \ntechnology.\nAlongside the ultimate transition to zero \ncarbon emission technology, the roadmap \nfeatures a combination of fleet renewal, \noperational efficiencies, airspace \nmodernisation, Sustainable Aviation  \nFuel and carbon removal technology  \n(see pages 12 and 13). \nWe have taken a wide range of actions to \nhelp us make progress on the roadmap. \nOn new zero emission technology, we \nformed a new partnership with Rolls-Royce \nto pioneer the development of hydrogen \ncombustion engine technology capable of \npowering an easyJet sized aircraft in the \nfuture with ground testing already \nsuccessfully underway. We formed \nhydrogen technology partnerships with \nGKN Aerospace and Cranfield Aerospace \nSolutions and were the first airline to \nsupport Airbus\u2019s ZEROe programme. \nA modern fleet of aircraft is instrumental in \ndriving down emissions and so we will be \nmaking a list price investment of $21 billion \nover the coming years to continue to \nrenew our fleet. All 168 new aircraft \ndeliveries, scheduled between FY23 and \nFY29, will be Airbus NEO aircraft, which are \nat least 15% more fuel efficient and 50% \nquieter than the aircraft they replace. \nDuring the year we also announced several \ntechnology developments, including a \nmulti-million-pound fleet-wide investment \ninto the latest technology from Airbus to \nachieve further carbon emission reduction \nthrough Descent Profile Optimisation.\nWe have contracted all Sustainable \nAviation Fuel (SAF) reflected in our \nroadmap for the next five years with \nsupplier Q8 Aviation and also signed a \nletter of intent with Airbus to support the \ndevelopment of ground-breaking carbon \nremoval technology. \nAs we move towards delivery of our net \nzero roadmap, we are transitioning our \ncurrent investment in carbon offsetting \ninto supporting the technologies that will \nhelp us decarbonise.\nLooking beyond carbon, we became the \nfirst low-cost carrier worldwide to have a \nfully-certified IATA Environmental \nAssessment (IEnvA) Environmental \nManagement System, showing we are \nmanaging our environmental performance \nin a structured and systematic way. \nWe continue to support the vital work of \nUNICEF both through its Covid-19 Vaccines \nAppeal and collecting donations to help \nsupport children and families affected by \nthe war in Ukraine. \nMeanwhile, easyJet holidays continues to \nfind ways to further optimise the benefits \nof travel and tourism to destination \ncommunities (see page 40). \nSo in summary, informed by our roadmap \nwe are investing millions where we can \nmake the most difference, in efficiency \nmeasures now and in the development and \nrealisation of net zero technology in the \ndecades to come. \nBy continuing our leadership in this area \nand implementing our roadmap step by \nstep, we will help ensure a sustainable \nfuture of aviation for the benefit of the \nnext generation and our planet.\nI\u2019m incredibly  \nproud of the  \nprogress that we,  \nand our partners,  \nhave made this year \nand believe that \neasyJet is an industry \nleader on its journey  \nto net zero.\u201d \nMESS", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

KPMG International entities provide no services to clients. All rights reserved. \nForeword\nDear readers, \nSustainability has become one of the defining \nmegatrends affecting businesses worldwide. And the \nM&A world is no exception to the rule.\nAcross sectors and around the world, more and more \ndeals are starting to be influenced by sustainability \ncriteria. Targets with strong sustainability stories (and \nthe data to back it up) are enjoying price premiums. \nAnd M&A teams are increasingly conducting \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) due \ndiligence (DD) on targets at an early stage. \nTo find out what this means for dealmakers across \nEurope, the Middle East and Africa, we surveyed more \nthan 150 active dealmakers across the region. We \nasked them what works, what doesn\u2019t work and what \nchallenges they face going forward. We discussed \nvarious models for embedding ESG into DD. And we \nasked them to share their advice and insights based on \ntheir experience. \nWhat we found was little consensus around what ESG \nDD actually means. Dealmakers are divided about how \nbest to incorporate ESG DD into their existing due \ndiligence frameworks. ESG DD work is often \nunderfunded. And ESG DD is not always aligned to the \norganization\u2019s overall ESG strategy. \nYet the data also suggests that dealmakers have made \nthis area a key priority. And they are determined to see \nhow ESG DD can not only help identify and manage \npotential risks, but also identify significant financial \nupside driven by ESG transformation. The importance \nof getting ESG DD right has never been clearer. \nIn this report, we explore the findings of our survey \nand one-on-one interviews with dealmakers. \nLeveraging insights gained from KPMG firms\u2019 \nexperience in ESG and due diligence, the authors offer \nsome tips and advice to help dealmakers evolve and \nmature their ESG DD capabilities. And we share some \npractical examples from KPMG firms\u2019 work in the area. \nWe hope this report provides EMA dealmakers and \nstrategy leaders with new ideas and motivation to \ndrive forward their ESG DD capabilities. To learn more \nabout the topics raised in this report \u2013 or to discuss \nyour organization\u2019s unique ESG DD situation \u2013 we \nencourage you to contact any of the KPMG \nprofessionals listed at the back of this report. \nTo find out what ESG DD \nmeans for dealmakers across \nEurope, the Middle East and \nAfrica, we surveyed more than \n150 active dealmakers across \nthe region.\n02\n2022 EMA ESG Due Diligence Study\nHow leading M&A teams are managing ESG DD\n\n\u00a9 2022 Copyright owned by one or more of the KPMG International entities. KPMG International entities provide no services to clients. All rights reserved. \nSummary of key findings\nSomething exciting is happening at the nexus of M&A and ESG. Dealmakers are actively \nintegrating ESG considerations into their deal activities. Investors across the board are ramping \nup their ESG due diligence efforts. And premiums are being paid for targets that meet ESG \npriorities. Dealmakers see the financial value and potential uplift opportunities that can be \nachieved by understanding a target\u2019s ESG-related performance at an early stage of the \ntransaction process. Read Chapter 1 to learn more.\nHowever, there are still major challenges faced by ESG DD practitioners. Specifically, \nthere appears to be no market consensus around what a standard ESG DD scope would \ninclude, as practitioners struggle with the breadth of the term \u201cESG\u201d. And targets aren\u2019t \nalways able to provide quality data or documentation. As such, practitioners can often struggle \nto quantify their findings and related financial impacts or value creation opportunities. Read \nChapter 2 to learn more.\nNonetheless, there are clear indications of \u201cwhat good looks like\u201d. Mature ESG DD \npractitioners are making a strong link between their overarching corporate sustainability \nstrategy and their ESG DD procedures. They are connecting their ESG DD findings to post-\nclosing actions. And they are focused on value creation opportunities (i.e. \u201cupsides\u201d) rather \nthan just mitigation of risks. They are also more likely to mandate a dedicated ESG DD \nworkstream, as opposed to a \u201cfragmented\u201d model where \u201cE\u201d, \u201cS\u201d, and \u201cG\u201d topics are \nhandled by separate workstreams. Financial investors appear to be somewhat ahead of the \ncurve in terms of ESG DD maturity. Read Chapter 3 to learn more.\nThe immediate priorities for dealmakers are becoming clear. First, dealmakers need to \nunderstand their company\u2019s ESG strategy and identify the areas that are truly material. This \ncan help them break through the complexity caused by the breadth of the term \u2018ESG\u2019. Second, \nthey need to develop a \u201cblueprint\u201d for their ESG DD approach, both in terms of intellectual \nframework as well as in terms of organization (dedic", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

It\u2019s within this context that we are pleased to \nlaunch KPMG\u2019s inaugural ESG Assurance Maturity Index, developed to help inform \ncompanies, investors and wider stakeholders on the current landscape. It comes \nat a pivotal time, as companies globally undertake a critical journey to prepare for \nnew ESG regulatory requirements.\nMost companies are already doing some reporting \non ESG topics, primarily on a voluntary basis. But \nnow the rules and market demands are changing, \nand what was once done at a company\u2019s \ndiscretion is now becoming mandatory and \nsubject to independent third-party assurance. \nTime is of the essence as sustainability reporting \nframeworks come into force.1\nTo gain investor and stakeholder confidence and \nmitigate the risk of greenwashing, ESG reporting \nshould be subject to a level of scrutiny \ncomparable to the financial information that users \ndepend on. This means that companies need to \ninvest in and improve data quality by applying \ndisclosure control and risk frameworks akin to \nthose used in financial reporting.\nThe impending regulatory requirements are \nunquestionably driving the urgency to become \nready for ESG assurance, but that is just part of \nthe story. As our Index and research show, the \npotential benefits to becoming assurance ready go \nbeyond mere compliance. Stakeholders from \ninvestors to employees to society as a whole \nwant to know more about how companies are \noperating in a sustainable way. This has been the \nimpetus for the regulatory action but assuring ESG \ndata can more broadly contribute to a company\u2019s \nreputation. The rigor and processes required to \nobtain ESG assurance can improve operations \nthrough accurate insights for decision-making, risk \nmanagement and efficiency gains. \nThe KPMG ESG Assurance Maturity Index and \nassociated research are designed to offer a path \nforward and provide a roadmap with guidance on \nareas to focus on, and the steps to take to \nbecome ready for ESG assurance. \nKPMG professionals are right there on the journey \nwith you. We are operationalizing ESG across our \nglobal organization to ensure our KPMG firms\u2019 \nESG assurance work is performed to the same \nconsistent level of rigor and quality as our financial \naudit activities and benefits from the same \nadvanced technology platform.

Forward-looking \nstatements give the Group\u2019s current expectations or forecasts of future events. \nAn investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate \nstrictly to historical or current facts.

In particular, these include statements \nrelating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future \nperformance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, \nexpenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, dividend \npayments and financial results. Other than in accordance with its legal or \nregulatory obligations (including under the Market Abuse Regulations, UK \nListing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the \nFinancial Conduct Authority), the Group undertakes no obligation to update \nany forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, \nfuture\u00a0events or otherwise. Investors should, however, consult any additional \ndisclosures that the Group may make in any documents which it publishes \nand/or files with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. All investors, \nwherever located, should take note of these disclosures. Accordingly, no \nassurance can be given that any particular expectation will be met and \ninvestors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking \nstatements.

We describe below the general reporting \nmethodologies and boundaries related to both \nnon-environmental and environmental reporting. \nWhere there are exceptions to these general \nreporting methodologies and boundaries, these \nhave been included with the specific metric in \nthe tables that follow.\nGeneral reporting methodology and \nboundaries,\u00a0covering both non-environmental \nand environmental metric reporting\nI. Reporting period\nOur reporting covers the financial year ended 30 June 2023 unless \notherwise stated.\nII. Scope\nUnless otherwise stated1, the boundaries for all non-financial \ninformation disclosed in the Annual Report and the ESG Reporting \nIndex include the performance of the global operations of Diageo plc \nand its subsidiaries, together with the attributable share of the results \nof significant joint ventures and joint operations. \nThe reporting boundaries are based on the principles outlined by \nthe\u00a0non-financial reporting strategy of our management, the nature \nof each indicator and, in the case of our greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions metrics, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. \nEnvironmental data and health and safety data is collected and \nreported for all operational sites and office sites with more than 50 \nemployees where we have operational control. The environmental \nimpacts associated with leased facilities that do not meet the criteria \nalready mentioned are excluded and considered immaterial to the \ncompany\u2019s overall impacts. This scope is reviewed every year to \nassess the data and extent of impacts. \nGHG emissions associated with leased vehicles under operational \ncontrol are being reviewed and reassessed to determine material \nsignificance to overall emissions and extent of overlap with Scope 3 \nindirect emissions. This review will be concluded in fiscal 24; our \ncurrent estimate indicates leased vehicles may contribute 4%-5% \nof\u00a0Scope 1 emissions or <0.5% of Scope 3 emissions.\nMaterial changes to environmental reporting methodologies are \nratified at quarterly 2030 grain-to-glass Strategic Business Review \nmeetings, chaired by the President, Global Supply Chain & \nProcurement and Chief Sustainability Officer.\nExceptions to and limitations of each indicator are explained in the \nfollowing pages of this document. \nIII. Baseline and targets\nThe financial year ended 30 June 2020 is our baseline year. \nIt\u00a0applies\u00a0to the majority of our \u2018Society 2030: Spirit of Progress\u2018 goals. \nExceptions are described in the following pages. The baseline data \nis\u00a0used as the basis for calculating progress against our goals.\nWe aim to achieve each goal by fiscal 30, unless otherwise stated \nin\u00a0the following pages of this document. \nIV. Acquisitions and disposals\nNew acquisitions are included in the consolidated reporting for \nnon-financial disclosure from the date when control passes or \nas\u00a0soon\u00a0as practically feasible, and no later than one year after \nassuming operational control.2 This duration varies as each \nnew\u00a0acquisition has unique systems and processes that must be \nintegrated. In case of disposals, data associated with the divestment \nis removed from the baseline, intervening years and current year \nunless otherwise stated in the following pages.\nV. Restatements\nWe may have to restate historical data due to structural changes \nin\u00a0our operations, including from acquisitions and divestments; \nimprovements in data accuracy and calculation methodologies; \nmaterial changes to relevant policies; and material changes in our \nnon-financial reporting.\nTo determine whether we need to restate historical data, we examine \nwhether the qualitative or quantitative impacts of the changes to our \nnon-financial reporting are material enough to compromise the \naccuracy, consistency and relevance of the reported information. \nIn\u00a0case a restatement for environmental data is necessary, we restate \nthe data for the baseline year and intervening years.\nIn case of our environmental data, we may need to adjust data to \nreflect updates to GHG emission factors, in line with the GHG Protocol \nrecommendations; and any changes in reporting policy that result in \na\u00a0material change to the baseline of more than 1%. We also restate \ndata where we can show that structural changes regarding outsourcing \nand insourcing have an impact of more than 1%. In certain cases, \nwhere historical data is unavailable, the environmental impacts for the \nbaseline year and intervening years are extrapolated from current \nenvironmental impact data, based on production patterns.\n1.\t\u0007Non-financial information, including baseline information, excludes the p", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Although ArcelorMittal\u2019s management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, investors and holders \nof ArcelorMittal\u2019s securities are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult \nto predict and generally beyond the control of ArcelorMittal, that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially and adversely from those expressed \nin, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include those discussed or identified in the filings with the \nLuxembourg Stock Market Authority for the Financial Markets (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier) and the United States Securities and Exchange \nCommission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) made or to be made by ArcelorMittal, including ArcelorMittal\u2019s latest Annual Report on Form 20-F on file with the SEC. In particular, \nArcelorMittal\u2019s carbon emissions targets are based on current assumptions with respect to the costs of implementing its targets (including the costs of green hydrogen \nand their evolution over time), government and societal support for the reduction of carbon emissions in particular regions and the advancement of technology and \ninfrastructure related to the reduction of carbon emissions over time, which may not correspond in the future to ArcelorMittal\u2019s current assumptions. For example, the \nCompany could face significant financial impacts in Europe if it is unable to make the necessary investments to decarbonise and reach its 35% target by 2030 due to \nthe design of European policy.

In some locations we have already seen significant \nenergy reductions, reducing our overall CO2-footprint. In order \nCEO Mikkel Bardram\nThis year EG has worked hard to \nreduce our energy consumption \nusing our own technology and by \nutilizing a flexible working model.\n4\t\nESG Report 2022\n\nto reach these results, we have \namong other initiatives implement-\ned our own Energy Management \nSystem, EG EnerKey / EG Omega, \nusing sensor technology and arti-\nficial intelligence to assess where \nand when we need to turn energy \nconsumption up and down in our \nfacilities. Furthermore, we use our \nown software, EG Worksense to \nmake sure we optimize the use of \nour facilities and can reduce space \nand energy consumption, where it \nis not needed. \nWe value our employees as one of our most important assets \nand I am happy that we have been able to maintain a high level \nof employee engagement in 2022. As a company we offer a \nsafe and stable working place combined with a high degree of \nindividual possibilities like working remotely, internal talent \ndevelopment and an informal and inclusive tone of voice. This \nis not a culture that generates itself. It is a culture that we tend \nto and nurse. We have in 2022 established a Global Diversity \nCommittee by asking our employees if they want to join and \ngenerate ideas on how to work even \nmore with diversity and inclusion.

However, \nwhile these matters must be considered when undertaking the \ndirector\u2019s primary duty, which is to promote the success of \nthe company for the benefit of its shareholders, they are effec-\ntively secondary to that primary duty.  In other words, the UK \nis currently a jurisdiction that effectively mandates shareholder \nprimacy in directors\u2019 discharge of their duties, albeit in parallel \nwith a need to consider other stakeholders at the same time.\nThe Companies Act requires large and medium-sized compa-\nnies (measured by reference to turnover, balance sheet total and \nnumber of employees) to publish an annual strategic report.  The \nreport must set out information on various ESG-related items, \nsuch as the impact of the business on the environment, disclo-\nsures around the company\u2019s employees, social, community and \nhuman rights issues, and the company\u2019s policies in relation to \neach of those matters.  If the company\u2019s securities are traded \non a particular securities exchange (for example, the Main \nMarket of the London Stock Exchange plc (the \u201cLSE\u201d)) or if \nit is a \u201cpublic interest entity\u201d, the Companies Act requires the \nreport to contain a \u201cnon-financial information statement\u201d.  This \noverlaps considerably with the content requirements already \ndescribed, but additionally covers respect for human rights, and \nanti-corruption and anti-bribery matters.  Finally, the legisla-\ntion requires large companies to include a separate statement in \ntheir report explaining how, in the financial year in question, the \ndirectors took the matters described above into account when \nfulfilling their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act.\nIn addition, all companies (except the very smallest) must \nprepare an annual directors\u2019 report.  Large companies must include \ninformation in their directors\u2019 report on how, during the financial \nyear in question, the directors had regard to the need to foster the \ncompany\u2019s business relationships wi", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The CEF supports \nfinancial aid, scholarships, faculty \npositions, and research activities\u2014\nand links past, current, and \nfuture generations of University \nstakeholders, including students, \nfaculty, and staff.\nThe primary investment objective of the\n CEF is to earn a rate of return over an extended \nperiod while preserving its asset value. It is \nthe University\u2019s core belief that supporting \nresponsible business practices is integral to \nproducing strong investment outcomes.\nThis is not a new concept at Pitt. In fact, \nthe Office of Finance, which manages the CEF, \nhas been incorporating many of the concepts \nnow referred to as environmental, social, and \ngovernance (ESG) factors in its due diligence \nprocess on a case-by-case basis since 1990. \nIn an effort to reaffirm that commitment and \ndevelop a more consistent and comprehensive \napproach, the ESG policy for the CEF was \nestablished in March 2020.\nFurthermore, the Ad Hoc Committee on \nFossil Fuels, convened by the University\u2019s Board \nof Trustees, strongly supported the current \nlong-term strategy of the University\u2019s CEF, \nwhich is expected to continue to pursue strong \nrisk-adjusted financial returns while reducing \nprivate holdings in fossil fuel exploration and \nproduction to zero by the end of 2035. The Ad \nHoc Committee also directed the University \nto provide greater transparency regarding the \nfossil fuel trends of the CEF in an ESG report.\nT\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Office of Finance       ESG Report \n2    \nThis inaugural report seeks to provide \ngreater clarity regarding how ESG factors are \napplied in the investment decision-making \nprocess as well as report on fossil fuel trends \nas requested by the Ad Hoc Committee.  \nIn addition to providing an introduction \nto the University\u2019s endowment, the report \ndiscusses several topics:\nPitt\u2019s ESG Policy Development: \nThe ESG policy considers a range of factors \nwhen evaluating investment risk. Those factors \ncould include energy efficiency, hazardous \nmaterials management, climate change, \nwater and land management, data protection \nand privacy, human rights, labor standards, \nproduct safety, accounting and audit \nstandards, bribery and corruption, business \nethics, and regulatory compliance. To develop \nthis policy, the Office of Finance benchmarked \nthe policies published by public and private \npeer universities, including those with similar \nendowment sizes.\nProgress on ESG Policy Implementation:\nPitt\u2019s progress to date shows how ESG \nfactors are being applied consistently across \nall asset classes, including the expansion of the \nstandard, formal due diligence questionnaire, \nwhich is now answered by every potential \ninvestment manager. The Office of Finance also \nemploys a sustainability materiality map that \nidentifies key risk factors along the dimensions \nof environment, social capital, human capital, \nbusiness model and integration, and leadership \nand governance. Additionally, the report \nfeatures four case studies that illustrate \nthe impact of applying ESG factors when \nconsidering specific investment opportunities. \nIt is important to note that there is not currently \nan agreed-upon set of ESG standards or metrics \nin the investment industry. As a result, this \nreport discusses more of a qualitative approach \nin applying ESG factors currently employed by \nthe Office of Finance, and as shown in the case \nstudies. As common standards are developed \nand quantitative metrics are agreed upon, we \nwill look to broaden our reporting.\nFuture Trends:\nThe report looks to project some trends with \nregard to ESG factors. However, there are some \nchallenges in providing comprehensive metrics \non ESG factors. For example, information on \nESG factors is consistently available only on \npublic equity and corporate fixed-income \ninvestments that constitute approximately \none-fifth of the CEF as of June 30, 2021. \nFurthermore, the investment industry and \nregulators are still in the process of developing \na common set of standa", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": " \n \n \nKEY CONSIDERATIONS ON ESG DISCLOSURE POLICY \nDESIGN FOR CHINA \nINTRODUCTION \nThe United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is the world\u2019s leading \ninitiative on responsible investment. The PRI has over 2500 signatories (pension funds, insurers, \ninvestment managers and service providers) globally with approximately US $85 trillion in assets \nunder management.  \nResponsible investment explicitly acknowledges the relevance to the investor of environmental, \nsocial and governance (ESG) factors in investment decision-making for the long-term health and \nstability of financial markets.  \nABOUT THIS BRIEFING \nThis briefing provides technical guidance as part of the PRI\u2019s work on ESG disclosure in China, with \nsupport from the UK China PACT Programme. It is based on the research and recommendations of the \nreport ESG Data in China: Recommendations on Primary ESG indicators. This research showed that \nwhile there was broad alignment between international and Chinese corporate environmental, social \nand governance (ESG) data disclosure practices, the disclosures being provided by Chinese companies \nare not standardised and not readily comparable across markets, industries and portfolios. The report \ncommented that this lack of comparability limits investors\u2019 ability to integrate ESG data into their \ninvestment decisions, and acts as a barrier to increased investment in green and sustainable assets.  \nThe report therefore recommended that Chinese financial regulators introduce a mandatory \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure framework, requiring all major companies to \nreport on a series of standard ESG indicators and to supplement these quantitative metrics with \nrelated information on governance, strategy and risk management. \nIn addition to this report, PRI was asked by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to \nprovide guidance on the specific regulations or regulatory clauses that would be required to \nimplement these recommendations. \nThis briefing is the PRI\u2019s response to that request. It identifies the key questions and considerations \nthat would need to be addressed by any regulator seeking to introduce corporate ESG disclosure \nrequirements. It also recommends draft wording that could be adopted for Chinese legislation on \ncorporate ESG reporting. \nWhile this briefing has been informed by our work on similar legislations in other jurisdictions, there \nis not yet a single \u2018best practice\u2019 ESG disclosure legislation. Different countries have taken different \napproaches depending on their specific contexts, e.g. the maturity of ESG or sustainability reporting \n\nESG Disclosure policy \u2013 Key considerations on policy design for China \n2 \n \nin the domestic market, national environmental, social and economic priorities, pre-existing reporting \nrequirements such as industry codes or stock exchange disclosure requirements, the needs and \ninterests of investors. Current efforts of international organisations and industry stakeholders, \nincluding PRI and ICGN\u2019s project on Meaningful Data, aim to establish global, standardised and \ncomparable corporate ESG reporting. The CSRC should therefore ensure that the disclosure policy they \nput in place could be re-aligned with any future global standardised ESG disclosure recommendations. \nThis note focuses on overarching implementing legislation. In jurisdictions where similar regulation \nhas been adopted, it has tended to be supplemented by more detailed guidance over time, covering \naspects such as calculation methodologies and reporting formats. Such materials, while important, fall \noutside the scope of this briefing. \n \n \n\nESG Disclosure policy \u2013 Key considerations on policy design for China \n3 \n \nKEY CONSIDERATIONS ON ESG DISCLOSURE POLICY IN CHINA \nWhen designing legislation on mandatory ESG reporting requirements, policymakers need to start by \nanswering a number of important questions. We set these questions out below together with some \nreflections on the factors that Chinese regulators need to consider when implementing an ESG \ndisclosure requirement for companies. \n \nKey Question 1: Rationale \nWhat is the purpose of the legislation? \nThese objectives will define the specific data and information to be reported, and will define the companies \nthat are expected to report. \nThe reasons for introducing mandatory ESG disclosure requirements can include some or all of: providing \nbetter information to investors, providing information to other stakeholders, encouraging and enabling \nbetter corporate oversight and management of sustainability-related issues, and increasing investment in \ngreen and sustainable assets. \nProposed implementation for China \nAs discussed in the ESG Data in China: Recommendations for Primary ESG Indicators, in order to provide \nusable and comparable ESG data to investors, companies should be required to report on a standardised set \nof primary ESG disclosure indicators. \nMore generally, the", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Le societ\u00e0 che fanno \nparte del network di F2i costituiscono per dimensione la principale piattaforma \ninfrastrutturale del Paese, diversificata in settori strategici per il sistema economico \nnazionale: Energie per la transizione, Reti di distribuzione, Trasporti e logistica, \nReti e servizi di telecomunicazione e Infrastrutture socio-sanitarie. \nLa capacit\u00e0 di trasformare le risorse finanziare affidate da investitori nazionali \ned esteri in progetti di economia reale dal forte impatto sul territorio, fa di F2i un \nattore primario per lo sviluppo del Paese.

The Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) launched the world\u2019s first science-based targets for nature. An \ninitiative aimed at guiding companies in assessing and prioritizing their environmental impacts and setting a standard \nfor targets to address these issues. The move represents a significant milestone towards helping companies take \nintegrated action across freshwater, land, ocean, biodiversity, and climate. \n\u2022  The new science-based targets for nature provide guidance for \ncompanies to holistically assess and prioritize their environmental \nimpacts, and to prepare to set targets, beginning with freshwater and \nland, alongside climate through the Science Based Targets initiative \n(SBTi). It builds on a global momentum on climate, with over 2,600 \ncompanies already setting science-based targets for climate through \nthe SBTi. The targets on nature complement existing climate targets, \nby allowing companies to take holistic action to address their impact in \nthe face of mounting environmental and social crises. \n\u2022     An initial group of seventeen global companies are preparing to submit \ntargets for validation, including AB InBev, Danone\u2019s Alpro, Bel, \nCarrefour, Corbion, GSK, H&M Group, Hindustan Zinc Limited, Holcim \nGroup, Kering, L\u2019OCCITANE Group, LVMH, Nestl\u00e9, Neste Corporation, \nSuntory Holdings Limited, Tesco and UPM. \nthe U.S., called on all Parties, especially major economies, whose 2030 \nNDC targets or long-term low greenhouse emission development \nstrategies (LTS) are not yet aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and net zero \nby 2050 at the latest. A call to revisit and strengthen the 2030 NDC \ntargets and publish or update their LTSs as soon as possible and well \nbefore COP28, and to commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. The G7 \nalso asked Parties to commit at COP28 to peak global emissions \nimmediately and by no later than 2025. \n\u2022     The G7 looks forward to the ISSB\u2019s future disclosure on biodiversity and \nhuman capital, remaining committed to support the implementation and \nmonitoring of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. The G7 also \naims to accelerate the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels to achieve net \nzero in energy systems by 2050 at the latest in line with the trajectories \nrequired to limit global average temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C above \npreindustrial levels. The Group reaffirmed its commitment to the \nelimination of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 or sooner, and \nreaffirmed previous calls for all countries to do so. \nn. The change will \nmostly rule out air trips between Paris and regional hubs such as Nantes, Lyon and Bordeaux, with connecting flights \nunaffected. Critics have noted that the cut-off point is shy of the roughly three hours it takes to travel from Paris to the \nMediterranean port city Marseille by high-speed rail. \n                                    \u2022      The law specifies that train services on the same route must be frequent, \ntimely and well-connected enough to meet the needs of passengers who \nwould otherwise travel by air, and also able to absorb the increase in \npassenger numbers. People making such trips should be able to make \noutbound and return train journeys on the same day, having spent eight \nhours at their destination. \n \nRESEARCH \n \n1. Deloitte published a report pointing out that 55% of Gen Z and 54% of Millennials research a company\u2019s \nenvironmental impact and policies before accepting a job. Deloitte surveyed 14,483 Gen Zs and 8,373 Millennials \nin 44 countries to explore their attitudes about work and the world around them. According to the survey\u2019s results, \nemployers have made progress, but high expectations for businesses among Gen Zs and Millennials go largely unmet. \n\u2022   Climate change is a major ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Launched in 2009, the Five Arrows team currently consists of over \n260 professionals based in Paris, London, Luxembourg, New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. \nThe Five Arrows Sustainability strategy is part of a comprehensive approach that is defined at the \nRothschild & Co Group level (\u201cR&Co\u201d, or \u201cthe Group\u201d), specifically covering the Five Arrows Managers \nLLP, Five Arrows Managers SAS, Five Arrows Managers North America LLC, Five Arrows Managers USA \nLLC and Rothschild & Co Investment Managers legal entities, hereinafter referred to as \u201cFive Arrows\u201d.\nThis report summarises our sustainability vision and outlines the way we look to tackle the \nmain sustainability-related risks and opportunities that we face.\nPurpose and context\n\nOur sustainability journey began in 2012 when we became a signatory of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI). \nOur commitments have grown steadily over time: we have been a signatory of the France Invest ESG Charter since 2014; we created our Sustainability \nBoard in 2015; and we began training our investment professionals through the UN PRI Academy in 2016. In 2021, we created a dedicated sustainability \nteam, currently comprising 3 full-time professionals. In 2022, we defined our new sustainability strategy, which reflects our determination and desire \nto address sustainability in a comprehensive, operational and ambitious manner. \nThe Five Arrows investment philosophy is deeply-rooted in the notion of long-term thinking, including in respect of sustainability matters, resulting in a \nsustainability strategy that is:\n Ambitious because of the range of topics we look to tackle, the objectives we set ourselves, and the speed at which we move to meet these goals. \n Inclusive because everyone has a role to play - from back-office to front-office, and from junior to senior. The governance and training programmes we \nhave established evidence this.\n Innovative because we will inevitably reinvent the way we work internally and with our partners. Collective intelligence and creativity are key to seizing \nopportunities and differentiating ourselves from our peers.\nOur strategy is built on three intertwined pillars, namely commitments that we make within our teams, our investments and our ecosystem.\n4\nOur sustainability strategy\nPurpose \nand context\nThe next steps\nin our journey\nOur\nteams\nOur sustainability \nstrategy\nOur\ninvestments\nOur\necosystem\nIn the latest UN PRI assessment, we achieved a score of 3 stars in the \u201cInvestment & Stewardship Policy\u201d module.\n\n5\nFigure 1.

In \naddition to national and local governments, many companies also set \ntargets for emission reductions. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the \nuptake of digitalization at a much faster pace than predicted, which led to \nsignificant changes for business and in the daily lifestyles and attitudes of \npeople. \nFor corporations to survive, it is evident that they must contribute to \nenhanced sustainability for society while bolstering their own resilience in \nthe face of rapid global transformations and an uncertain future. I believe it \nis essential to consider the interests of all stakeholders and adopt a \nmanagement approach that takes a long-term perspective on both societal \nsustainability and the economic realities of business operations. \nLast year we announced that the purpose of the Fujitsu Group was \u201cto make \nthe world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation\u201d. \nOur focus now is on purpose-driven management, in which all corporate \nactivities are oriented toward achieving that purpose. Fujitsu is undergoing \na comprehensive transformation, in both the financial and non-financial \nspheres, which encompasses our business portfolios, personnel and \nevaluation frameworks, organization, and corporate culture. \nFrom a financial perspective, we must address issues that will help to create \na sustainable society while also ensuring our competitive advantage as a \ntechnology company. We have therefore defined seven key focus areas in \nour \u2018For Growth\u2019 domain and will concentrate future investments in these \nareas to boost sustainability for our customers and society and to drive \nFujitsu\u2019s continued growth. On the non-financial front, we are determined \nto transform our organizational culture by involving all Fujitsu Group \nemployees in the Fujitra Project \u2013 our in-house digital transformation (DX) \ninitiative. With the aim of developing businesses that take into account the interests of all stakeholders, we established a Global \nResponsible Business (GRB) framework that covers issues such as human rights, diversity and inclusion; wellbeing; the \nenvironment; and responsible procurement in the supply chain. As part of the GRB, we have outlined what Fujitsu aspires to be \nand have set goals for our various activities. One of these is a downward revision of the overall Fujitsu Group target for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, in line with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u2103, as we work to assist our customers and \nsociety in general on the path to carbon neutrality. \n \nTo measure the progress of Fujitsu\u2019s internal transformation efforts, in 2020 we introduced a range of non-financial indicators to \ncomplement the existing financial indicators. These additional management checks are designed to monitor the levels of trust \nshown by customers and employees and to track the progress of our in-house DX initiative. We are now working on a method for \nvisualizing the relationships between the financial and non-financial indicators, and also between the non-financial indicators \nand the GRB. Fujitsu is committed to data-driven management that uses forecasts derived by analyzing data on the company\u2019s \ngrowth, the contribution to enhanced sustainability for customers and society, and the company\u2019s internal transformation, as \nwell as by analyzing the relationships between these various data elements. In this way, we will advance toward achieving our \ncorporate purpose. \nTakin", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

This report has been produced by the finance community for the finance community. \nNuclear Energy: An ESG Investible Asset Class has been developed from the discussions of the Taskforce, all of \nwhom are listed in Appendix III of this report. The report could not have been produced without their valuable \ncontributions, and the contribution and oversight of Fiona Reilly, Co-Chair of the EMWG and Chair of the Taskforce. \nGIF would also like to express its gratitude to the Nuclear Industry Association in the United Kingdom, the Canadian \nNuclear Association, the Nuclear Energy Institute in the United States, Natural Resources Canada, and the Nuclear \nInnovation and Research Office and the National Nuclear Laboratory in the United Kingdom.  \nScope of the Report \nThis report has various sections: \n\u2022 \nClimate Financing and Responsible Investment: Sets out the international policy framework and \nbackground around climate finance including the UN\u2019s Principles of Responsible Investment, the rise of \nESG reporting and its role in accessing climate finance and the role of taxonomies and how they fit, or \nrather do not fit, with ESG reporting; \n\u2022 \nLow Carbon ESG Reporting: Provides a very high-level overview of how low carbon energy companies \nand/or projects could report against ESG; \n\u2022 \nNuclear Disclosures Against ESG: Demonstrates the nuclear industry\u2019s ability to report against ESG and \nwhy it is an investable asset class, if projects and companies are established and managed well;  \n\u2022 \nAppendix I Standard Metrics:  The Taskforce mapped the WEF ESG against relevant SASB and TCFD ESG \nto create a consolidated list of ESG, which are used in this report; and \n\u2022 \nAppendix II Consistent and Transparent Reporting: Provides significantly more details and cross-\nreferences for the finance community and wider stakeholders to use when considering nuclear companies \nand projects reporting together with some analysis where other energy companies could follow the \nnuclear industry\u2019s lead in their ability to report against ESG.  \nIt is hoped, and intended, that this report develops into a living document that is used by the finance industry as a \nreference and guide to use when considering nuclear companies and their assets. \n \n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nNUCLEAR ENERGY: AN ESG INVESTABLE ASSET CLASS, GIF 2021 \n5 \nTable of contents \nNuclear Energy: An ESG Investable Asset Class .................................................................................................... 1 \nForeword ............................................................................................................................................................ 3 \nScope of the Report ............................................................................................................................................ 3 \nTable of contents ................................................................................................................................................ 5 \nList of abbreviations and acronyms ..................................................................................................................... 7 \nExecutive summary ........................................................................................................................................... 11 \nGovernance ........................................................................................................................................................... 12 \nPlanet .................................................................................................................................................................... 13 \nPeople ................................................................................................................................................................... 13 \nProsperity .............................................................................................................................................................. 14 \nReferences ............................................................................................................................................................. 15 \nIntroduction and background ............................................................................................................................ 17 \nNuclear and renewable", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

This report \nintends to provide transparency on how we assess \nthe environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nperformance of companies we invest in, how we \nengaged with leadership and insights from our research \nduring the year. Through reporting on our approach \nto ESG, we want to communicate how we integrate \nresponsible investment principles into our investment \napproach. \nCountries across the world are grappling with issues \nsuch as climate change mitigation, climate change \nadaption, energy security, reliability and affordability. \nWe recognise these issues are complex and will require \na wide range of financial and technology solutions. In \nparticular, global listed infrastructure companies will be \nat the forefront of the global energy transition and will \nplay an integral part in achieving net zero emissions. \nAs long-term and active investors, we know that the \ninvestment decisions we make today will impact future \ngenerations. We take an active approach to proxy \nvoting to convey our views to boards and management \non important topics including board composition, \nremuneration packages and climate transition plans.\nThrough company engagement we seek to better \nunderstand risk in our portfolio, suggest areas for \nimprovement, increase transparency on ESG issues, \nand support companies that are making progress in \nthis area. We typically engage companies on material \nissues to achieve specific outcomes. More broadly, we \nparticipate in industry groups such as Climate Action \n100+ to push for change on complex issues such as \nenergy transition and the pathway towards net zero. \nAligning with FSI\u2019s firm-wide commitment, we are \ncommitted to building investment portfolios with a \ntarget of net zero by 2050 and are pursuing interim \ntargets by 2030 to reduce the Weighted Average \nCarbon Intensity of our investment portfolios1.  We will \nseek to prioritise the direction of capital to infrastructure \ncompanies that are aligned or aligning with a pathway to \nnet zero by 2050 and encourage the investment of this \ncapital into real assets that reduce absolute emissions. \nAs stewards of our clients\u2019 capital, we will continue to \nengage with companies on these issues with a view to \ndelivering more sustainable risk adjusted returns.\n1.\t\nThe team\u2019s net zero target applies to all Global Listed Infrastructure and Responsible Listed Infrastructure pooled vehicles, and to separate client accounts that are subject to equivalent \ninvestment guidelines.\nImportant Information\nThis material contains measurements and data relating to ESG factors and metrics, together with specific ESG related commitments and targets. \nThe measurements and data relating to ESG factors and metrics are estimates based on information sourced by the relevant investment team from third parties including portfolio companies and \nsuch information may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nThese commitments or targets are current as at the date of publication and have been formulated by the relevant investment team in accordance with either internally developed proprietary \nframeworks or are otherwise based on the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) Paris Aligned Investment Initiative framework. The commitments and targets are based on \ninformation and representations made to the relevant investment teams by portfolio companies (which may ultimately prove not be accurate), together with assumptions made by the relevant \ninvestment team in relation to future matters such as government policy implementation in ESG and other climate-related areas, enhanced future technology and the actions of portfolio \ncompanies (all of which are subject to change over time). As such, achievement of these commitments and targets depend on the ongoing accuracy of such information and representations as \nwell as the realisation of such future matters. \nAny commitments and targets set out in this material are continuously reviewed by the relevant investment teams and subject to change without notice.\n\n5\nFirst Sentier Investors  |  Global Listed Infrastructure 2022 Sustainability Report\nOur approach\nESG issues are fundamental to infrastructure \ncompanies, given they have significant service \nobligations and moral accountability to the communities \nin which they operate. We assess infrastructure \ncompanies on a broad range of ESG-related factors, \nincluding but not limited to energy transition, climate \nrisk, modern slavery and corporate governance.

We use innovative science and technology to address \nsome of society\u2019s most challenging healthcare issues. Yet, we \nrealize that our impact extends far beyond the patients and \nhealthcare professionals we serve, to other stakeholders such as \npolicymakers, investors, and our own associates, as well as the \ncommunities in which we operate. It is therefore important that we \nunderstand all their needs if we are to deliver on our purpose and \nensure we create a positive impact on those around us. Materiality \nassessments play a critical role in helping us accomplish this goal.\nSince we began these assessments in 2006, they have helped \nus learn about the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) \ntopics that matter most to our stakeholders, as well as assess \nstakeholder expectations. They have also helped us understand \nhow our stakeholders perceive our performance in these areas, \nand, importantly, where and how we can improve.\nThe 2021 Novartis Materiality Assessment is our fourth and \nrepresents the most robust piece of employee and stakeholder \nengagement we have carried out to date. The results show that \nboth internal and external stakeholders are aligned in prioritizing \nfour main areas: patient health and safety, access to healthcare, \ninnovation, and ethical business practices. While all the topics we \ndiscuss in this assessment are important, it is these four themes \nthat have been identified as being the most material globally for our \ncompany.\nAs we work to further evolve our ESG strategy and to make \nprogress toward our vision to become the most valued and trusted \nmedicines company in the world, listening to our stakeholders and \nensuring our efforts are in step with their insights and needs has \nnever been more important. \nOn behalf of Novartis, I would therefore like to thank everyone \nwho has taken the time to participate in this assessment and look \nforward to continuing this constructive dialogue in the months and \nyears ahead.\nSincerely, \nLutz Hegemann,\nPresident, Global Health & Sustainability\nLutz Hegemann, \nPresident, Global Health & Sustainability\n\n4 | GLOBAL MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT 2021 | ESG Management Office\nAbout this Report\nAbout this Report\nThis report summarizes the results of the 2021 \nNovartis Materiality Assessment, as well as the \nmethodology used. This assessment is undertaken \nevery four years and is critical for embedding \nmateriality at the core of our business. This systematic \napproach enables us to assess both our stakeholders\u2019 \nviews on the impacts Novartis has on society and \nthe environment, and the potential impact of outside \nevents on our business. Materiality assessments \ntherefore constitute a valuable management tool for \nour company.\nWhile a number of best practice guidelines from \ninternational standard setters exist, none of them \noutline how to actually undertake such an exercise. \nThrough our materiality assessment, and by \nincorporating the latest thinking about the topic into \nour methodology, we therefore aim to set the standard \nfor what constitutes best practice when it comes to \nembedding stakeholders\u2019 views about materiality into \na company\u2019s processes.\nAt Novartis, we believe focusing on material ESG topics will drive financial performance and \ndeliver meaningful impact for society. As a company, we constantly evaluate the impact we\u2019re \nhaving on the world to make good on the social contract we have with countries and patients.\u201d \nVas Narasimhan, \nChief Executive Officer\nThe Novartis Materiality Assessment \nis a valuable tool because it enables us \nto take onboard the perspectives of a \nwide range of stakeholders on how we \ncan improve our impact on society.\u201d \nJoerg Reinhardt,\nChairman of the Board of Directors\nThe materiality analysis helps us identify \nfocus areas for the company, which the \nBoard of Directors oversees through \nits committees.

We need to continue growing in order to reach \nat least 10%.  In Russia too, where Renault, Nissan and \nAVTOVAZ hold one-third of the market. However, the market \nshare of the Renault brand alone is between 7% and 8%. Our \ngoal is to reach 10% here as well. In India, Renault is already \nthe leading European brand.

We saw many companies\u2019 growth buoyed by COVID-19 therapeutics, and the majority of others remaining \nfairly immune to some of the pandemic impacts initially feared (e.g., slowdown in patient recruitment and trial execution). We \nanticipate further growth in the industry as life sciences companies continue to transform.\nSome companies, especially those with limited legacy ways of working, are coming out of the pandemic adopting a digital-first \nmodel and challenging norms across their enterprise. Those that made significant digital investments prior to the pandemic \nare benefitting from their bold vision as digital transformation accelerates every part of the life sciences value chain. In 2022, \nvisionary leaders will continue to drive investments focused on long-term, strategic digital objectives\u2014using automation, \nsmart factories, and artificial intelligence to transform manufacturing and using new technologies to build supply chain \nresilience. \nUncertain times will require a greater commitment to enterprise agility. The new world of virtual and hybrid work demands \nflexibility, and most life sciences companies will still be adjusting to new norms and a highly competitive talent landscape in the \nnear future. Reimagining work with a focus on corporate and working culture is a CEO strategic priority and meeting the needs \nof humans\u2014and human-centered experience in the workplace\u2014has never been more important. \nThe last two years of the pandemic saw unprecedented collaboration across life sciences and with stakeholders. Everyone \nwas mobilized in the interest of patients, including regulatory agencies around the world digitally sharing research.1 Over the \nnext year, more patient-centric, co-created experiences will evolve to make patients more equal partners in decision-making \nthroughout their journeys and help life sciences deliver better, more personalized outcomes. We anticipate more diversity in \nclinical trials driven by patients and a greater focus on health equity, enabled by decentralized trials among other strategies.\nIn 2022, data-driven scientists, armed with new sources of insights and real-world evidence, will be solving problems for \ndiseases that were once thought intractable.2 Scientific breakthroughs, like the mRNA technologies behind the COVID-19 \nvaccines and cell and gene therapies, have many potential use-cases for the future. The new processes adopted to expedite \nCOVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic products are now also being applied to speed up the development of other drugs and \ntreatments\u2014and companies cannot revert back to old ways.\nESG is expected to remain front and center in 2022, as companies face enhanced disclosures and new global standards. \nWatchdogs, investors, and customers will be scrutinizing life sciences\u2019 progress.3 In the year ahead, life sciences leaders \nwill be expected to focus on material ESG factors for the sector such as access to medicines, drug pricing, environmental \nsustainability, health and race equity, and diversity in leadership. \nChange will persist through 2022 and beyond. Many life sciences companies have experienced growth and are emboldened \nwith stronger balance sheets from which to invest. We anticipate investments in their portfolios, including next generation \ntherapies and investments, to capitalize on their digital progress. With access to a myriad of tools to gather and analyze data, \nit\u2019s time for life sciences companies to employ digitalization at scale. A new bar has been set, and agile companies, willing \nto move beyond convention to solve the toughest challenges, stand to reap the biggest benefits. The greatest challenge \nfor leaders in 2022 will be how to ensure they accelerate the progress made\u2014and not revert to pre-pandemic norms. Bold \nleaders with a clear, cohesive vision will continue to take advantage of the many opportunities the pandemic has surfaced and \naccelerated.\nIntroduction\n\n2022 Global Life Sciences Outlook | Digitalization at scale: Delivering on the promise of science\n4\nDriving productivity, a need for speed\nCurrently, many life sciences companies are ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Executive summary\nSantander is one of the largest banks in the eurozone. As of \nDecember 2020, we had EUR 1,508,250 million of assets \nand EUR 1,056,127 million of total funds. Our market \ncapitalization had reached EUR 44,011 million.\nOur purpose is to help people and businesses prosper in a \nway that is Simple, Personal and Fair. We do not merely \nmeet our legal and regulatory obligations, but also aspire to \nexceed expectations. We focus on areas where our activity \ncan have the greatest impact, helping economic growth in \nan inclusive and sustainable way.\nWe engage in all types of typical banking activities, \noperations and services. Our scale, business model and \ndiversification drive our aim to be the best open digital \nfinancial services platform, acting responsibly and earning \nthe lasting loyalty of our stakeholders (customers, \nshareholders, people and communities).\nIn 2020, against the backdrop of the pandemic, our \ncommitment to our stakeholders was even stronger:\n\u2022 Our priority was to safeguard the health and safety of \nour 191,189 employees, by implementing measures \nsuch as redefining our way of working, with more than \n100,000 employees working from home at the peak of \nthe pandemic, and gradual returns to the workplaces \namid de-escalation.  We followed local governments' \nrecommendations at all times and based our \nprocedures on three pillars: developing and \nimplementing of health and safety protocols, \nprioritizing the health of our employees, and tracking \nand tracing (through health apps).\n\u2022 For our 148 million customers, we strengthened our \nproposition, and implemented support measures to \nensure the necessary financial assistance through pre-\napproved  lines of credit, payment deferrals and special \npolicies, as well as facilitating the granting of state-\nguaranteed business loans in all countries.\n\u2022 For our shareholders, we kept all channels open to \nincrease their trust, which was reflected in an increase \nof more than 30,000 shareholders in the year to \n4,018,817.\n\u2022 In line with our commitment, we contributed to the \nwell-being of society. We implemented actions and \nmobilized resources together with governments and \ninstitutions to help combat the health crisis, with more \nthan EUR 105 million dedicated to solidarity initiatives.\nAs the global pandemic intensified, we accelerated our \ndigital transformation, focusing on our multi-channel \nstrategy and digitalization of processes and businesses.\nAs a result, loyal and digital customers and activity \ncontinued to grow. The number of loyal customers reached \n23 million (+6% in the year), picking up in individuals and \ncorporates. Digital customers rose 15% to more than 42 \nmillion.\nOn average, our customers accessed digital touchpoints \nclose to 190 million times per week and 44% of total sales \nwere digital (36% in 2019). We also aim to be one of the \ntop three banks for customer satisfaction in our main \nmarkets.\nBesides digital channels, we interact with our customers \nthrough our global network of 11,236 branches, which we \nare  optimizing and adapting to our customers' needs \nincluding universal offices and specialist centres for certain \ncustomer segments. We also have new collaborative \nspaces with increased digital capabilities (Work Caf\u00e9, \nSmartBank and \u00c1gil branches). \nEconomic Context\nIn 2020, Santander operated in an extraordinarily complex \nenvironment characterized by the pandemic and the \nmeasures to alleviate its economic impact.

For more \nthan two decades, we have been committed to \nimproving human health by unlocking the power of \nthe genome. Yet today, the need is more urgent than \never to help build a healthier, more sustainable world \nwhere all people can thrive. \nGenomics has the ability to improve global health \ncare, sustainability, and equity through better \ndiagnosis and treatment; better representation \nin genomic data; greater access to personalized \nmedicine; and a deeper understanding of the world. \nThis is the genome era, and the last few years \nhave shown the promise that exists around us.\nGenomics enables the world to act quickly and \nmitigate the spread of infectious diseases. \nThe world\u2019s first mRNA vaccine roll-out ignited a \nwildfire of genomic innovation and breakthroughs \nthat will improve human health beyond the pandemic. \nThere will always be new pathogens, but what \nmatters is our ability to identify and control their \nspread. Effective global surveillance, backed by \ncollaboration and adoption, can prevent the next \npathogenic outbreak from becoming another \nglobal pandemic. \u00a0\nGenomics is transforming personalized \nmedicine and saving lives. The science is being \napplied to every step of cancer care and reducing \nthe diagnostic odyssey for those suffering from rare \ngenetic diseases. Revolutionary therapies are hitting \nthe clinic and reinventing how we fight an expanding \nnumber of conditions. \nGenomic data has become the blueprint for \neverything from diagnostics to precision \ntherapeutics. Each day, researchers are learning \nmore about genetic variants that will help unravel \nthe world\u2019s most devastating diseases and public \nhealth challenges. Yet, genomic data is glaringly \nimbalanced \u2014 underrepresenting the diversity of \nglobal populations. Together with our partners, we \naim to increase the diversity of genomic data and \nhelp every patient access groundbreaking therapies.\u00a0\nGenomics is being brought to bear against the \nclimate crisis. We are already using genomics to \nunderstand which seeds will be most productive \nor most resilient to drought and disease. CRISPR \ngene-editing technology is starting to bolster the \nnatural ability of plants and soil microbes to both \ncapture and store atmospheric carbon. Genomics \nwill be an essential tool to fight food insecurity for \nmillions of people around the world. \nFrancis deS", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The ongoing COVID-19 health crisis is \ndriving an exponential expansion of our digital footprint. While this is bringing \nunprecedented conveniences into our lives and interactions, it is by no means \nequitable or sustainable.\nThe environmental challenges posed by this eruption are staggering. \nFrom high energy consumption and carbon emissions to burgeoning digital \nwaste and unrestrained extraction of rare earth minerals and precious metals \nlike cobalt for hardware, the price we are paying for digital progress \nis exorbitant.\nWhat\u2019s making matters worse is that its benefits are not fairly shared. \nAffluent citizens, corporates and countries with greater access to digital \nlearning and skills, infrastructure and data stand to gain the most. The gap \nis widening for those entities with lesser digital resilience and bridging it is \nbecoming more challenging every day.\nEven as the ubiquity of digital grows, citizens lack a holistic understanding \nof issues around digital media engagement and protection of personal data. \nThere is a lot of ground to be covered in terms of education and standards.\nAt Infosys, we are deeply invested in reimagining \nour digital future into a shared reality that \neveryone can adapt to with ease, and benefit \nfrom equitably. Our ESG Vision 2030 focuses \non shaping and sharing solutions to tackle this \nglobal challenge.

This is reflected \nin the annual financial statements. \nAt \u20ac26 billion, our revenue remained \nat a high level, with a return to growth \nin the fourth quarter. Our EBITDA came \nto \u20ac3.6 billion, exceeding the revised \ntarget we had set at the start of \nthe pandemic, and at \u20ac415 million, \nthe current net income Group share \nremained largely positive despite \nthe extent of the recession that most \ncountries in the world experienced. \nThe measures taken at the start of \nthe crisis enabled our Group to overcome \nthe consequences of the crisis and trend \npositively again in less than nine months. \nOur performance in the third and \nfourth quarters of 2020 exceeded our \n2019 performance for the same periods.\nHow do you explain the fact that Veolia\nmanaged to pull through the economic\nand health crisis so successfully?\nA.F.: First, the nature of our businesses, \nas they provide everyday life essentials, \nwhether for urban areas or businesses: \nduring a crisis or in normal times, \nthose customers still need water and \nheating, and waste and wastewater must \nbe collected and treated.\nSecond, our company\u2019s responsiveness \nin extreme events, its inventiveness \nin solving completely unprecedented \nproblems, and its boldness in countering \nthe uncertainty created by the crisis. \nThree guiding principles helped us through \nthis situation: ensure service continuity, \nprotect our employees and mitigate \nthe impact of the recession on our \nresults insofar as possible. For example, \nas a result of the Recover & Adapt \nadditional savings plan we rolled out, \nour Group ultimately saved \u20ac550 million \nin costs compared with the \u20ac250 million \ninitially expected. I would add a third, \nmore fundamental reason that underpins \nall the rest: our employees\u2019 exceptional \nengagement. They did their utmost \nto continue providing our services \nduring this difficult period, despite \nthe organizational disruption here and \nthere due to the crisis. They are keenly \naware of their tasks and were focused \nsquarely on fulfilling them, which \nthey successfully did.\nDespite the crisis, was your Group \nable to maintain its sales & marketing\ndynamic?\nA.F.: Yes, 2020 saw numerous successes \nhelping pave the way for the future. \nOur sales & marketing effort was vigorously \nmaintained with a focus on new businesses \nwhich will provide new areas of growth \nfor our company in the near future. \nA number of the contracts we won in 2020 \nclearly reflect our strategy, including \nthe acquisition of the right bank dis", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

We are \nconsequently seeing a shift in the \ncapital markets as products and \nservices transition towards more \nsustainable approaches. \nRegulation\nAs of 1 July 2020, a new ESG \nreporting framework was issued by \nthe HKEX for listed companies which \nincludes environmental and social \nKPIs to be disclosed. With a Cross-\nAgency Steering Group on Green and \nSustainable Finance launched in \n2020, more policy and regulatory \ninitiatives with enhanced \nrequirements on financial institutions \nand corporations regarding ESG are \nexpected, especially with respect to \nclimate. To this end, by 2025 TCFD \ndisclosures will be mandated in the \nfinance sector in Hong Kong. \nFrameworks\nAlthough no single environmental \nstandard exists, there are several \nrecognised standards that provide \nmarket guidance on how to \nmonitor, evaluate and report on \nenvironmental-related disclosures. \nMany organisations reference the \nframeworks in their ESG reporting. \nWhilst these frameworks are \nuseful, there is a need for better \nand more accurate data as this \ninformation is used by \npolicymakers, financial regulators \nand investors to make business \ndecisions. \nAs with financial reporting, the independent and objective assurance only internal audit can provide must \nbe an integral part of an organisation\u2019s ESG response. \nInternal Audit\u2019s role in ESG \nThe same but different: providing objective insights, \nassurance and advice - on ESG matters\nThere has been an uptick in ESG reporting worldwide, with a recent KPMG study demonstrating \nthat 80% of companies now report on ESG topics.\u00b9 Internal audit can play a critical role in providing \nobjective assurance and advice on ESG reporting and sustainability matters more broadly. \n\n\u00a9 2021 KPMG ASPAC Limited, a Hong Kong incorporated company and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent \nmember firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

The presence \nof international organisations and forums dedicated to \nGroup Chairman\u2019s\nForeword\ngood global governance further reinforce the region\u2019s \necosystem which we are part of. \nThis Swiss bedrock is synonymous with the strength of \nour Group. We remain naturally prudent and are privi-\nleged to be able to take a long-term perspective thanks \nto no competing voices or interests. We regularly rein-\nvest into equity capital, adding to the Group\u2019s stabil-\nity. The Group\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity stands today at  \nCHF 5.1 billion, making J. Safra Sarasin one of the best \ncapitalised banks in Switzerland.\nI have had the privilege of witnessing many different \neconomic cycles, and steering our Group through chal-\nlenging environments. The world today may seem par-\nticularly perturbed by competing visions of how govern-\nment should be conducted, of how economies should \nbe regulated and of how the financial sector should act \nmore responsibly. Broader challenges such as climate \nchange and the increasing digitalisation of services and \nsociety impact all people and sectors across the world. \nHowever, it is at times of greatest stress that human-\nkind also shows the most resilience and ingenuity to \nlearn and take different paths to progress.

As bankers, we are \nuniquely positioned to analyse the world and identify \nfavourable circumstances for our clients.\nThis brings me to a guiding principle of banking: if you \nlook after your clients carefully, and nurture your staff, \nthen everything else falls into line. When you lose sight of \nwhat is best for your clients or for your staff, then you en-\ndanger the very essence of banking: trust and reputation.\nOur Group\u2019s longevity is also due to simplicity through wise \nand considered investment, as well as a clear understand-\ning of our evolving environment. Deep involvement, risk \nmanagement, tight controls: these are trademarks of the \nconsistent way we run the Group. At its heart, wealth man-\nagement is a simple business \u2013 focusing on risk-adjusted \nperformance, but also ensuring good service, knowing your \nclients, and thinking about them all the time. \nIn 2019 we are celebrating 30 years since the Group \nconducted the first ever sustainability investment ana- \nlysis of a company. Sustainability is at the heart of the \nGroup\u2019s philosophy, and we continue to be a global lead-\ner in this investment approach. This year we have cho-\nsen the theme of trees to illustrate our commitment \nGroup Chairman\u2019s Foreword\nto sustainability. Trees are universally recognised as a \ncore part of the planet\u2019s ecosystem. They also repre-\nsent a continual cycle of renewal across generations, \nwhatever the environmental conditions. Different spe-\ncies of trees symbolise distinct qualities, many of which \nexemplify our approach to wealth management \u2013 such \nas endurance, protection, wisdom and renewal. \nOur core focus has always been, and will continue to be, \non our clients and their future generations. We carry out \nthis role with pride and passion. So long as we continue \nto focus on your needs, then we will do our job properly \nand prosper together.\nI would like to thank all our clients and employees for \ntheir trust and their significant achievements in 2018.

This includes maintaining robust risk, financial and operating controls; having an unwavering \ndevotion to our customers and communities; investing in our employees and fostering a diverse and inclusive \nworkplace; upholding a culture that reinforces integrity, fairness and responsibility; and advancing sustainability in \nour business and operations. \nWe also continually challenge ourselves to find ways to put our business to work for the benefit of all of our \nstakeholders, including those who are struggling the most. That is why we\u2019re fully engaged in trying to help solve \nsome of the world\u2019s biggest challenges \u2014 including racial inequality, climate change and the need to advance an \ninclusive economic recovery.  \nToday, this is frequently described as environmental, social and governance \u2014 or ESG \u2014 management. I think of it \nsimply as the smart way to do business. \nOur firm\u2019s strategy to help accelerate the shift to a more sustainable, low-carbon future is one example of our work in \naction. We are targeting to finance and facilitate more than $2.5 trillion over 10 years to advance climate action and \nsustainable development. In addition, we are aligning key financing portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement \nand working with our clients to finance their decarbonization strategies \u2014 efforts that are intended to drive near-term \nactions that will help set the world on a path to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. \nWe also committed $30 billion to advance racial equity. Structural barriers in the U.S. have created profound racial \ninequities, which the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated. JPMorgan Chase is working to do our part by harnessing \nour expertise in business, policy and philanthropy to address key drivers of the racial wealth divide and provide \neconomic opportunity to underserved communities, especially Black and Latinx communities. We are also redoubling \nour efforts to build a more equitable and representative workforce within our own company.\nUltimately, our long-term business success depends on the success of the communities we serve. In this report, I \ninvite you to learn more about the ways we strive to operate a thriving company that we can be proud of, and all the \nways JPMorgan Chase is putting its business to work for our stakeholders. \nJamie Dimon\nChairman & CEO, JPMorgan\u00a0Chase\u00a0&\u00a0Co.\n3\n2020 Environmental, Social & Governance Report\n\nOur Approach to ESG\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cJPMorgan Chase,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cthe firm\u201d) has built its reputation on \nbeing there for our clients, customers and communities. The events of 2020 \u2014 the global COVID-19 pandemic, a societal \nreckoning with systemic racism and the increasingly visible effects of climate change \u2014 underscore why understanding, \nanticipating and effectively managing environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters is critical to delivering on \nour mission to serve our clients, customers and communities. Now, more than ever, a strong focus on ESG is a business \nimperative \u2014 and a key driver of long-term business success. \nAt JPMorgan Chase, ESG matters are an important consideration in how we do business, including our corporate governance systems, risk \nmanagement and controls, human capital management, approach to serving clients and customers, support for local communities and \nmanagement of our physical operations. We recognize the potential for ESG-related risks, which we work to identify and manage just as we \nmanage risk in all areas of our business. Equally important, we believe companies like ours have an obligation to put their businesses to work \nfor all of their stakeholders. For our firm, this means we are leveraging our business and policy expertise, data, capital and global presence to \nhelp drive an inclusive recovery, expand access to economic opportunity and accelerate sustainability", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Throughout this period of uncertainty, JPMorgan Chase has led with a \ntireless focus on doing the right thing, even when it\u2019s not easy or expedient. \nWe are leveraging capital and expertise across our company to support a greener \nfuture for the planet and advance racial equity. This is a pivotal time for society \u2013 \ngovernment, business and community leaders must move from empty statements \nand lofty intentions to tangible actions. That is why our company is beginning to \nimplement ambitious targets and commitments to help drive equity and create a \nmore resilient world.\nA responsible approach to energy and climate, especially during a time of war, is to \nimmediately help provide energy security around the globe while remaining focused \non accelerating the development of affordable, reliable and lower-carbon energy \nsolutions. We have a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of our financing portfolios, \nstarting with oil & gas, electric power and automotive manufacturing, and targeting \n$1 trillion by 2030 \u2013 as part of an overall $2.5 trillion sustainable development \ntarget \u2013 to advance renewable energy and other innovative technologies. And we \nare minimizing the environmental impact of our physical operations across \nthousands of branches, as well as our data centers and corporate offices. \nWe are also making progress in implementing our $30 billion commitment to help \nclose the racial wealth gap. Financing affordable places for people to live, expanding \naccess to services through local community branches, and supporting Minority \nDepository Institutions and Community Development Financial Institutions are a few \nexamples of how we\u2019re putting this commitment to work. Because racial equity, like \nclimate, requires a coordinated government response, we are advocating for policies \nthat diversify the appraisal industry, help Americans with no credit file gain access \nto credit and provide access to affordable small business loans.\nFinally, we can only run a strong company and tackle these challenges if we have \nexemplary people. I am so proud of how hard our employees have worked through \nthese tough times and the continued steps we\u2019ve taken to cultivate a diverse and \ninclusive workplace and support our customers and communities. \nThere is no doubt we \u2013 both as a company and society \u2013 have a long way to go. We \nmay not get it right every time, but we strive every day to do the right thing. \nMoments of crisis are also moments of opportunity. In this year\u2019s ESG report, I invite \nyou to read about the work we do every day to drive lasting change.\nJamie Dimon\nChairman & CEO, JPMorgan\u00a0Chase\u00a0&\u00a0Co.\n2\nINTRODUCTION\nMessage from Our Chairman & CEO\nCompany at a Glance\nOur Approach to ESG\nFeature: Our $2.5 Trillion \nSustainable Development Target\nENVIRONMENTAL\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\nESG REPORT APPENDICES\n\nCompany at a Glance\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.

We prioritized care for our \nemployees so we could provide the essential products that \nthe world was counting on. \nAs the world's focus expanded beyond the pandemic to \ninclude social and racial injustice, our values dictated how \nwe would use the strength of our culture and trusted brands \nto advocate for and promote inclusion, drive diversity, and \ndisrupt bias - at first with our employees around the world, \nand later in the communities where we live and work.  \nThese once-in-a-lifetime events forced us to both embrace \nand redefine how we care for each other, our customers, \nour consumers, our communities, and our planet, and they \naffirmed a shared purpose for our company that was not fully \nrealized until the pandemic required a singular focus on care.\nThis sense of purpose is at the core of our ambitious \nsustainability strategy, which we introduced last year: to uplift \nthe lives and well-being of 1 billion people around the world \nby 2030, with half the environmental footprint in the areas \nwhere we can make the biggest difference \u2013 climate, forests, \nwater, and plastics.\nWe know the hard work is still ahead of us. Yet, the \nconversation around sustainability is changing, and growing \nfor good means that we must be bolder and act faster to \naddress the social and environmental challenges facing our \nconsumers, our communities, and the planet. In setting these \ngoals for ourselves, we believe we are futureproofing our \nbusiness for generations to come.\nThis year\u2019s report showcases the incredible response from our \nteams to an extraordinary year, and it reflects how we live our \npurpose every day.\nMike Hsu  \nChairman, CEO, and Proud Employee  \nKimberly-Clark\nOur Strategy for the \nDecisive Decade\nOur Business \nin 2020\nMaking  \nLives Better\nSmallest Environmental \nFootprint \nLeadership \nMessage \nLeadership \nMessage \nA Message from Mike Hsu\nA Message from Lisa Morden\n\nThe Essentials for a Safer, \nHealthier World \nThe past year presented previously unimaginable \nchallenges that put health and safety at the forefront \nwhile illuminating social and environmental gaps \nthat still need to be bridged.

Executive\u00a0summary\nA growing number of companies around the world have voluntarily adopted and implemented a\u00a0broad \nrange of sustainability practices as a\u00a0response to emerging challenges and stakeholder expectations \nacross the environmental, social and governance (ESG) space. These\u00a0efforts have resulted in \na\u00a0proliferation of data and ratings available to investors to help them integrate ESG performance in \ntheir capital allocation decisions. Academics\u00a0and practitioners using ESG information have presented \nextensive evidence on the benefits of integrating ESG criteria into the investment process, from both \nan operational and risk\u2011return perspective.\nIn a\u00a0seminal paper, Professor George Serafeim and co\u2011authors found that firms with good ratings on \nindustry\u2011strategic sustainability issues deliver significant financial outperformance over firms with poor \nratings on the same issues.1 The\u00a0research made a\u00a0clear distinction between ESG issues that are deemed \nmaterial and immaterial within an industry. In\u00a0contrast with immaterial factors, material ESG factors \nare sustainability issues that are likely to impact the financial condition or operating performance of \na\u00a0company and, therefore, are most important to investors.\nWhile ESG materiality\u2011focused research has proliferated, to date there has been limited research \nfocusing on the impact of ESG factors on returns in the financial sector, and more specifically in the \nbanking industry.\nThe Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV) consists of banks that focus on delivering value to \nsociety by using finance to deliver sustainable economic, social and environmental development. \nThe\u00a0GABV believes that this focus delivers stable financial returns. Supporting\u00a0this hypothesis is the \nannual research of the GABV, commencing with year end 2010, comparing the financial profiles and returns \nof its members with the largest banks in the world.2 The GABV, along with the European Investment Bank \nand Deloitte have supported this research to give more scientific weight to the hypothesis that an ESG \nfocus increases firm value. To\u00a0that end, the purpose of this report is to test the relationship between ESG \nand financial performance within the context of the commercial banking industry.\nUsing publicly available data on each of the 100\u00a0banks included in the sample (see Appendix for the list of \nbanks), we evaluated and scored banks on their pursuit of material and immaterial sustainability issues. \nIn\u00a0analysing their stock returns from 2007 to 2017, we determined that those banks that consistently \nscored high on material ESG issues delivered higher risk\u2011adjusted returns compare", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

It would not be possible \nor desirable to produce a list, or a set of definitions, that claimed to be exhaustive or definitive. Any such list \nwould inevitably be incomplete and would soon be out of date. \nNonetheless, the table below provides examples of ESG issues, for guidance purposes. This is intended primarily \nfor signatories who are relatively new to responsible investment and to the PRI.  Some modules (e.g. Property) \nprovides examples of ESG issues that are specific to that  sector or asset class. \nEnvironmental (E) \nIssues relating to the quality and functioning of the natural environment and natural \nsystems.  These include: biodiversity loss; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, climate \nchange, renewable energy, energy efficiency, air, water or resource depletion or  \npollution,  waste management, stratospheric ozone depletion, changes in land use, \nocean acidification and changes to the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. \nSocial (S) \nIssues relating to the rights, well-being and interests of people and communities.  \nThese include: human rights,  labour standards in the supply chain, child, slave and \nbonded labour, workplace health and safety, freedom of association and freedom of \nexpression, human capital management and employee relations; diversity; relations \nwith local communities, activities in conflict zones, health and access to medicine, \nHIV/AIDS, consumer protection; and controversial weapons. \nGovernance (G) \nIssues relating to the governance of companies and other investee entities.  In the \nlisted equity context these include: board structure, size, diversity, skills and \nindependence, executive pay, shareholder rights, stakeholder interaction, disclosure \nof information, business ethics, bribery and corruption, internal controls and risk \nmanagement, and, in general, issues dealing with the relationship between a \ncompany\u2019s management, its board, its shareholders and its other stakeholders. This \ncategory may also include matters of business strategy, encompassing both the \nimplications of business strategy for environmental and social issues, and how the \nstrategy is to be implemented. \nIn the unlisted asset classes governance issues also include matters of fund \ngovernance, such as the powers of Advisory Committees, valuation issues, fee \nstructures, etc. \nNumerous organisations and projects have identified ESG issues by sector, together with associated key \nperformance indicators.   Examples include: \n\u2022 \nThe European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS): KPIs for ESG - A Guideline for the \nIntegration of ESG into Financial Analysis and Corporate Valuation \n\u2022 \nThe CFA Institute: Environmental, Social and Governance Factors at Listed Companies - A Manual for \nInvestors \n\u2022 \nUNEP FI and WBCSD: Translating environmental, social and governance factors into business value \nESG research providers and brokers are also well placed to provide advice in this area. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \nActive/ Passive investments \nDefinition \nACTIVELY AND PASSIVELY MANAGED STRATEGIES \nPassive strategies \nPassive investments are investments which mirror the performance of an index and \nfollow a pre-determined buy and hold strategy that does not involve active \nforecasting. Examples include investments in broad capital market indices, ESG \nweighted indices, themed indices, passive managed ETFs or indices with ESG-\nbased exclusions. \nMore detail on ESG integration for passive investors can be found later in this \ndocument.  \nActive - quantitative \n(quant) strategies \nInvestment strategies or funds where the manager builds computer-based models to \ndetermine whether an investment is attractive. In a pure \"quant model\" the final \ndecision to buy or sell is made by the model.  \nMore detail on ESG integration for active investors can be found later in this \ndocument. \nActive - fundamental  \nFundamental strategies in which investment decisions are based on human \njudgment.

Our \nongoing research on the industry\u2019s dynamics \nand performance has revealed several insights, \nincluding the following trends: \nPrivate markets bounced back in 2021. After a \nyear of pandemic-driven turbulence that suppressed \nfundraising and deal activity, private markets \nrebounded across the board. Fundraising was up by \nnearly 20 percent year over year to reach a record \nof almost $1.2 trillion; deal makers were busier than \never, deploying more than $3.5 trillion across asset \nclasses; and assets under management (AUM) grew \nto an all-time high of $9.8 trillion as of July, up \nfrom $7.4 trillion the year before. Dollars continued \nto fund higher risk-return strategies in private \nequity (PE) and infrastructure and rotated into riskier \nstrategies in real estate.\nA new set of risks emerged at the beginning of \n2022 with the potential to undermine growth and \nperformance. The Russian government\u2019s invasion \nof Ukraine, higher inflation and interest rates, and \nsupply chain and labor challenges are already \nincreas\u00ading volatility three months into the new year.\nPrivate equity continued to drive global growth \nin private markets. Fundraising rebounded across \nregions, and global totals fell just short of the pre-\npandemic peak established in 2019. AUM reached a \nnew high of $6.3 trillion, driven primarily by asset \nappreciation within portfolios. With a pooled IRR of \n27 percent in 2021, PE was once again the highest-\nperforming private markets asset class. PE \nalso continues to outperform relative to most public \nmarket equivalent (PME) measures.\nLPs increased their exposure to earlier-stage \nprivate investing. Venture capital (VC) continued to \nattract capital on the back of a decade of strong \nperformance but was outpaced by growth equity. \nWith increased funding for VC and companies \nremaining private for longer, the investable universe \nof growth companies has expanded substantially. \nPE firms have moved to fill the space, and the supply \nof growth equity vehicles has evolved: in the last \nten years, six of the ten largest buyout managers \nhave launched a growth vehicle. Today, VC and \ngrowth equity combined make up 47 percent of PE \nfundraising, just shy of buyout\u2019s share.\nPE fundraising \u2018winners\u2019 do so by growing their \nflagships and raising more frequently. While \nproduct proliferation plays a role, the 20 firms that \nhave gained the greatest share of new capital \nraised over the last five years have done so \npredominantly by raising larger and more frequent \nflagship vehicles. These firms more than doubled \nthe size of their flagship funds over the preceding \nhalf decade and raised every three years, on \naverage. Last year\u2019s report showed that top-quartile \n2\nPrivate markets rally to new heights\n\nperformance of the preceding vehicle in a fund \nfamily tends to lead to rapid growth of the next \niteration. This year\u2019s data show that strong \nperformance coupled with rapid deployment leads \nto share capture. \nDeal activity surged, but average deal multiples \ndid not. Global buyout and growth equity deal \nvolume grew nearly 50 percent year on year to over \n$2 trillion in more than 14,000 transactions. A \npandemic-driven backlog of companies that delayed \nsales processes in 2020 undoubtedly played \na role in this year\u2019s record total.

The novelty of the indicator, compared with the corporate \nsocial responsibility scores and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores already available, is \ndue to its unique coverage, namely, a large number of private sector small and medium-size enterprises in \nselected emerging economies (more than 40 economies covered by the Enterprise Survey). The \ncomposite indicator summarizes information on private sector actions on environmental, social, and \ngovernance factors. The analysis shows that the actions of private sector small and medium-size \nenterprises in emerging economies to foster sustainability and green growth significantly lag in the \ntransition to a more sustainable business environment, and large gaps persist. Among emerging \neconomies, those in the Middle East and North Africa\u2014which deserve special attention due to the \nurgent need to green their growth model\u2014are among the worst performers. Larger companies in the \nMiddle East and North Africa show better environmental, social, and governance performance than \nsmall and medium-size enterprises in other areas;  but smaller firms in the Middle East and North Africa \nshow extremely weak performance in many aspects, even if controlling for the relative level of \neconomic development. The weakness of environmental, social, and governance practices among firms \nin the Middle East and North Africa is due to the social (with large gaps in female participation in the \nworkforce and management) and environmental topics. This calls for urgent policy action to address \nsuch weaknesses and exploit the full potential of the region.  \nJEL codes: C43, M14, Q56, R11 \nKeywords: ESG, environmental, social, governance, sustainability, corporate responsibility, SME, Middle East and \nNorth Africa, index aggregation \n1 m.ferrazzi@eib.org, Senior Economist, European Investment Bank, Economics Department; a.tueske@eib.org, Economist, \nEuropean Investment Bank, Economics Department.

The future of humanity can \nonly be green. It is not a matter of choice. A green, \nsustainable tomorrow is imperative.\nThis is a major vindication for the Metaxa Hospitality \nGroup. What appeared to be merely a romantic \noutlook in 1999, when we \u2013 as a Group \u2013 prepared \nour first sustainability report, is now the realistic view. \nWe are therefore proud of this long journey, during \nwhich we have shown our consistent dedication \nto sustainable development, having horizontally \nimplemented sustainability across all our activities. \nRecorded in the Sustainability Report for 2021 are \nlong-standing and new innovative initiatives that we \nimplement at our hotels for society, the economy, the \nenvironment \u2013 and we highlight the best practices \nthat we follow for our people, the market and society \nas a whole. \nWe reaffirm the Group\u2019s strategic orientation, which \nis to minimise the environmental footprint that our \nactivities have on nature and to maximise our positive \nfootprint at the destinations where we operate. \nSustainability is an long-term challenge. It is met \nday by day, year by year. We want every sustainability \nreport to be a step further towards achieving new \ngoals of higher added value. That is why we are \nalways in dialogue with local communities and their \npeople, so that we can constantly enrich our actions \nand respond responsibly to new needs. This is what \nencourages us and inspires us as we travel the path \nof sustainable hospitality. \nWe will unwaveringly continue on this trajectory \nfor the years to come. The new age is giving new \nmeaning to hospitality, and this must come from the \nheart. Only when this notion is genuine can it create \nthe unique, authentic experience that our guests \ndeserve, sustainability for our environment, and \nwellbeing and cohesion for our local communities.\nI hope you enjoy this report.\nMESSAGE FROM THE CEO\nAndreas N.

Zinc normally causes \nshort-circuiting during charging when used in \nrechargeable batteries, but NGK has solved this problem \nand developed a zinc rechargeable battery by utilizing its \nproprietary hydroxide ion conducting ceramic separator. \nHighly safe, this zinc rechargeable battery is an optimal \nstorage solution for indoor installations.\nSubnano-ceramic membranes\nWe have developed a variety of subnano-ceramic \nmembranes, which are able to separate specific \nmolecules from mixed liquids or gases. These new \nceramic filters make possible innovative separation \nprocesses that have the potential to save energy and \nreduce costs.\nLithium-ion rechargeable \nbatteries, \u201cEnerCera\u00ae\u201d \nThe EnerCera series is a line of compact, thin, high \nenergy density lithium-ion (Li) rechargeable batteries \nutilizing NGK\u2019s proprietary crystal oriented ceramic plate \nas electrodes. One of the particular features of these \nbatteries is their high heat resistance. The series is \noffered in two types: \u201cEnerCera Pouch,\u201d which can be \nembedded in IC cards using hot lamination; and \n\u201cEnerCera Coin,\u201d the world\u2019s first Li-ion battery that can \nbe reflow-soldered to circuit boards and is capable of \nhigh current discharge.

Sample issuers\nprovided information on (i) the ESG governance structure;\nand (ii) where there is a designated working group or\ncommittee for ESG matters, the roles and duties of such\nworking group or committee.\nOur research shows that around 71% of the Constituents\nin Hang Seng Index are now having some form of ESG\ncommittee \u2013 whether that be described as an ESG\ncommittee,\na\ncorporate\ngovernance\ncommittee,\nsustainability\ncommittee,\ngovernance\ncommittee,\nsustainable development\ncommittee or\nenvironmental\ncampaign committee, etc.\nWhile each ESG committee will have its own specific\nterms\nof\nreference,\ndrawing\non\ninsights\nfrom\nour\ninteractions with directors and business leaders, we\nhighlight seven issues for ESG committees to keep in\nmind as they consider and carry out their 2023 agendas.\nClarityofpurpose\nOversight of ESG risks and opportunities is a significant\nchallenge, involving the full board and potentially multiple\nboard committees. For example, elements of climate such\nas\ndisclosure\nand\nDEI\nare\noverseen\nby\nthe\nESG\ncommittee, with assistance from other committee such as\nNomination and Governance committee.\nGuidance on\nClimate Disclosures2 by the HKEX recommends two\ngovernance structures that organisations can follow, the\nintegrated approach and the dedicated approach. In the\nintegrated\napproach,\nmanagement\nof\nclimate-related\nissues\nis\nintegrated\ninto\nexisting\nstanding\nboard\ncommittees\n(e.g.\naudit,\ngovernance,\nnomination,\nremuneration and risk committees). While a standalone\ncommittee is established in the dedicated approach.\nOn the 2023 ESG \ncommittee agenda\nKPMG Board Leadership Centre \nConsideration needs to be given to the coordination\nbetween committees as well as the information flows to\nthe\ncommittees\nfrom\nthe\ncorporate\nfunctions\n(risk,\noperations, legal, etc.) and from the committees to the\nboard itself. For example, climate change might initially\nappear to reside with an ESG committee, but it will also\nlikely touch the audit committee (data, the systems that\nproduce that data, and the disclosures within the annual\nreport),\nthe\nremuneration\ncommittee\n(management\nincentives), and the nomination committee (the skills and\nexperience of board members and senior management).\nOverlap is to be expected, but this puts a premium on\ninformation sharing,\ncommunication,\nand coordination\nbetween the committees. It also requires that committees\nhave the expertise to oversee the issues delegated to\nthem.\nAnESGcompetentboard\nOversight of ESG risks \u2013 and equally importantly, the\nopportunities \u2013 starts with an ESG-competent board. Not\nevery board member needs to have deep-dive ESG\nexpertise, but the board, as a whole, needs to have ESG\nrisk and its impact on opportunities such as long-term\nvalue creation, top of mind. They need to understand\nwhich issues are of greatest risk such as business\nresilient and sustainability or strategic significance to the\ncompany, how they are embedded into the company\u2019s\ncore business activities, and whether there is strong\nexecutive leadership behind the company\u2019s response to\nESG matters.\nIndividual member of ESG committee may have different\nexpertise on different topics.

The report highlights the company\u2019s \nfinancial and non-financial performance for the year and gives an update on strategy, \ninnovation, digitalization and sustainability.  \n \nNestl\u00e9 has also sent the Annual General Meeting (AGM) invitation and agenda to \nshareholders.  \n \n2020 Annual Report \nDespite the challenges of COVID-19 in 2020, Nestl\u00e9 delivered strong results, achieving \nimprovements in organic sales growth, profitability and capital efficiency for the third \nyear in a row. Nestl\u00e9 also continued to make progress on its portfolio transformation \nthrough targeted acquisitions and divestments that focus on attractive, high-growth \nbusinesses.  \n \nA key contributor to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s growth is its consumer-driven innovation that also strives \nto reduce the company\u2019s environmental footprint. Some examples highlighted in the \nreport include the launch of Sensational Vuna, a plant-based tuna alternative, and the \nincreased use of paper packaging for brands such as Maggi. The company further \nreduced the average time to market of such innovative products by another 10% and \nincreased the number of multi-market launches by 23%.  \n \nNestl\u00e9\u2019s continued digital transformation enabled it to accelerate growth and better \nengage with consumers in a year that saw a surge in online shopping. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s e-\ncommerce sales grew by 48.4% and accounted for 12.8% of total Group sales in 2020. \nAdditionally, more than 60% of all of the company\u2019s digital media campaigns used a \ndata-driven, audience-first approach to personalize messaging to consumers.  \n \nIn the Creating Shared Value (CSV) section of the report, Nestl\u00e9 highlights that it has \nfully achieved 28 of the 36 commitments it had previously defined to support the \nUnited Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals. Those commitments focus on \npromoting healthier lives, improving livelihoods and protecting and restoring the \nenvironment. The full CSV and Sustainability Report will be published on March 23.  \n \nThe full Annual Report contains Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Annual Review as well as the Corporate \nGovernance & Compensation Reports and the Financial Statements, which were \npublished on February 18, 2021. \n \n\n2/2 \nRead about these topics and more in the Annual Report \n \n \n \nAnnual General Meeting and Sustainability  \nIn addition to the traditional AGM agenda items, Nestl\u00e9 will ask its shareholders to \nsupport its recently published climate roadmap in an advisory vote at this year\u2019s \nmeeting. In December 2020, the company published its detailed, time-bound plan for \ncutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in half by 2030 and for achieving net zero \nemissions by 2050. The reporting of non-financial performance is becoming \nincreasingly important, and as previously announced, the company believes that \nshareholders should have a say on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) \nmatters. Nestl\u00e9 welcomes upcoming changes to Swiss legislation in this area. In the \ninterim, the Board of Directors is seeking the support from shareholders on its climate \nroadmap.  \n \nEach year at the AGM, shareholders have the opportunity to vote on the total \ncompensation of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Board of Directors and Executive Board. This year, Nestl\u00e9 is \nchanging the structure of Executive Board members\u2019 short-term bonus. Fifteen percent \nof that bonus will now be linked to the achievement of ESG-related objectives. The \nNestl\u00e9 Board of Directors sets those objectives at the beginning of each year, in line \nwith the company\u2019s strategy.  \n \nAs already communicated, Nestl\u00e9 is also splitting the existing Nomination and \nSustainability Committee into a separate Nomination Committee and a focused \nSustainability Committee. This reflects the importance of sustainability in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s \ncorporate governance and allows Board members to dedicate more time, focus and \naction on each of these important topics. \n \nAhead of the upcoming AGM on April 15, Nestl\u00e9 will also publish its first Task Force on \nClimate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report.

Proximus Group comprises Proximus \nSA, its subsidiaries, as well as the Group\u2019s interest in associates \nand joint ventures accounted for under the equity method and \njoint operations.

Back then, ESG investing was \na niche investment strategy that was adopted by \nonly the most sustainably conscious of asset and \nwealth managers. Nonetheless, this marked the onset \nof a paradigm shift in the investment landscape - \nestablishing the first voluntary link between sustainability \nand financial services. This was a watershed moment in \nsustainable finance, preceding major milestones such \nas the signing of the UN Paris Agreement in 2016 and \nthe release of the European Commission\u2019s Action Plan \non Financing Sustainable Growth in 2018. These have \ntightened the reins on the sustainable finance agenda, \nimplementing mandatory minimum standards and \nhighlighting how the asset management industry could \nplay a key role in driving positive change.\nIn the new decade, the wheel that began turning in 2015 \nhas reached unparalleled speed; and ESG has gone \nfrom a trend to a revolution of proportions unseen in \nthe European fund industry since the advent of UCITS \nand AIFMD. Virtually all stakeholders in the asset \nmanagement landscape are attributing strategic focus \nto sustainability issues, and the Asset and Wealth \nManagement (AWM) industry\u2019s role in addressing them. \nInstitutional investors, in particular, are prioritising \nnon-financial impacts alongside financial returns, \ndemonstrating a strong proclivity for sustainable \nproducts and managers. Moving forward, we expect to \nsee this trend mirrored by retail investors as millennials \nincreasingly enter the investor base and upcoming \nchanges to MiFID investment suitability rules encompass \nsustainability factors. \n\nPwC Luxembourg | 5\nWe are seeing a similar shift in sentiment among \nEU policymakers, with a recent surge in regulatory \nmomentum embedding ESG as a central tenet of \nthe investment landscape. The above resulted in a \nwidescale blurring of the boundary between traditional \nand sustainable investment; a boundary which we \nexpect to have all but disappeared by 2022, by which \nthe Taxonomy and Sustainable Finance Disclosure \nRegulation will have been fully implemented in the \nEU. Widespread unrest surrounding racial and gender \ninequality, rising wealth disparity and the escalating \nclimate crisis have added fuel to the ESG fire; further \nhighlighting the room for improvement in managers\u2019 \napproaches to considering ESG investment criteria and \nembedding ESG standards within their own corporate \nprocesses. Successful change will require the alignment \nof both services, products and corporate sustainability.\nIn PwC\u2019s \u201cSustainable Finance, A New Era for Asset \nManagers\u201d report published earlier this year, we initiated \na discussion about how changing regulation was \nexpected to impact asset management operations and \nhow managers could best prepare for imminent change. \nEvidently, recent e", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

We are upgrading \nour technology infrastructure; \naugmenting our artificial \nintelligence, robotics and \nautomation expertise; \nrenovating and building new \nfacilities; and continually adding \nnew talent across our organization.  \nI am proud of our team\u2019s ability to balance our \nfocus on near-term performance with the drive to \nbuild a foundation for future growth. \nIn this context, I am pleased to present Ranpak\u2019s \n2021 ESG Impact Report.  I invite you to read on \nand see the continued progress we have made on \nESG matters.  While this is our third ESG report, \nit is our first report since announcing long-term \nenvironmental targets last year.  And it is with \nrespect to our progress towards our targets that I \nam especially proud.  Specifically:\n\t\u203a 100% FSC\u00ae-CERTIFIED PRODUCT BY 2030.  In \n2021, 62% of the paper packaging material we sold \nwas FSC\u00ae-certified, up from only 3% in 2020.   \n\t\u203a 75% RECYCLED CONTENT (PIW & PCW) BY \n2030. In 2021, 60% of the pulp used to manufacture \nour paper supply was recycled content, up from \n55% in 2020.  \n\t\u203a 25% POST-CONSUMER WASTE (PCW) BY 2030.  \nIn 2021, we surpassed this target, with 38% of the \npulp used to manufacture our paper supply being \nPCW, up from 17% in 2020.  \n\t\u203a 46% REDUCTION IN GHG EMISSIONS BY \n2030. In 2021, our combined scope 1 and scope \n2 greenhouse gas emissions increased by \napproximately 12% from 2020, but decreased by 2% \nfrom 2019, the last year unaffected by COVID.    \nAs these results show, we made tremendous \nprogress on our FSC\u00ae-Certification and Recycled \nContent targets \u2013 and surpassed our Post-\nConsumer Waste target.  Substantially all of our \nPCW gains reflect our paper suppliers\u2019 increased \nuse of PCW as an ingredient in the paper we \nsource, a trend we hope will continue in 2022.  \nNevertheless, our engineering and product \nmanagement teams will continue to work hard \nto qualify additional papers \u2013 with more recycled \nand PCW content \u2013 for additional packaging \napplications.  \nAdditionally, we are making investments today that \nwill significantly reduce our emissions in the future. \nOur renovation and construction projects in Ohio, \nthe Netherlands and Connecticut all incorporate \ndesign elements that will make them more efficient, \nand therefore, more sustainable.  We have also \nalready begun the process of designing solar-power \ngeneration systems in Ohio and the Netherlands. \nTherefore, although our greenhouse gas emissions \nhave remained relatively unchanged from 2019 (with \na significant dip in 2020 due to COVID), we are \nconfident these investments will result in reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2023.\nAs a result, today, Ranpak is stronger than ever.  \nWe remain a business of approximately 850 \nglobal employees pushing the use cases and \neffectiveness of sustainable packaging further than \npreviously imaginable and wholly committed to \ndelivering a better world in everything that we do. \nOmar Asali | Chairman & CEO\n2021 ESG Impact Report\nOVERVIEW\nENVIRONMENT\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\nAPPENDIX\n\nTable of Contents\nOverview\n2\t Our Mission\n4\t Highlights\n6\t Innovation\n7\t Investment\n8\t \u0007Renovation & \nExpansion\n9\t \u0007Climate  \nResponsibility\nEnvironment\n10\t \u0007The Circular Economy\n11\t \u0007UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals\n12\t Sourcing\n16\t Water\n17\t Energy & Emissions\n20\tWaste Management \n22\tMachine Assembly\nSocial\n23\tStakeholders\n26\tCulture\n28\t\u0007Diversity & Inclusion \n29\tEmployee Focus\n30\tPay & Benefits\n31\t Safety\nGovernance\n32\tBoard\n33\tManagement\n34\tEthics\n35\t\u0007Risk Management\nAppendix\n36\t\u0007Additional Information \n37\tAbout This Report\n38\t\u0007GRI & SASB Content \nIndex\n41\t \u00072021 ESG \nPerformance \nSummary\n2021 ESG Impact Report\n1\nOVERVIEW\nENVIRONMENT\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\nAPPENDIX\n\nOUR MISSION: To Deliver a Better World \u2122\nDeliver a Better World is \nmore than a motto.

These opportunities are fueled by major \nsecular growth trends existing in Digitalization, Renewable Energy and the Energy \nTransition. For REC Silicon this is further enhanced by concerns around supply security and \nembedded competence that is driving major efforts towards re-shoring industries that \nwhere first developed and commercialized in the United States, such as Photovoltaics and \nSemiconductors. Along with underlying growth trends, the Investment Reduction Act, Chips \nAct and the Infrastructure Act all create clear pathways for us to run our current assets \ntowards full utilization as well as expand in areas where we have strong and distinct \npositions. As the largest producer of Silane and High Purity Granular outside of China and \nthe only one located in the United States, our entire production asset and product portfolio \nis uniquely positioned to translate these circumstances into further value for our \nshareholders. Simply put, we have the right assets, the right products at the right time and \nin the right place.\nSupport for the long-term success of the company was solidified in \n2022 as a result of the purchase by Hanwha Solutions and its affiliate \nHanwha Corporation of Aker Horizon\u2019s interest in REC Silicon along \nwith an additional share offering from the company as Hanwha became \nthe largest shareholder at 33.33%. REC Silicon\u2019s Board of Directors \nalso changed to the current Board comprised of Mr. Tae Won JUN as \nchair and Mr. Dong Kwan KIM as deputy chair both of whom are \naffiliated with Hanwha, along with Ms. Paraskevi (Vivian) Bertseka,  \nDr. Renate Oberhoffer-Fritz, and Ms. Roberta Benedetti as \nindependent Board members. \nIn 2022, REC Silicon announced the restart of the Moses Lake facility on \nthe heels of offtake opportunities to sell the production from the facility \nto Hanwha. Favorable governmental initiatives such as the Inflation \nReduction Act, which included SEMA has provided incentives to support \nthe reshoring of the PV industry within the United States that will also \ngreatly enhance REC Silicon\u2019s current and future prospects at Moses Lake. \nMoreover, the CHIPS Act is also expected to positively contribute to the \nsuccess at Butte as the Semiconductor industry continues its path \ntowards reshoring to the United States as well. Additional improvement \nand expansion opportunities for high value products manufactured at the \nButte facility, such as DCS, were identified and are now being implemented \nso that the Butte facility will continue to take advantage of market \nopportunities that are rapidly developing. \nAlthough the long-term prospects for REC Silicon have never been \nbrighter, there has also been some short-term challenges facing the \ncompany. The second half of 2022 has been a disappointment from \n\u201cSimply put, we have the right assets, \nthe right ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": " \n1. According to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, due diligence is a process during which companies can \nidentify, prevent, mitigate, and account for how they address their actual and potential adverse impacts as an integral part of \nbusiness decision-making and risk management systems. \nOrganisation \nOwner \nDocument type \nVersion \nVolvo Car Corporation \n50130 Global Sustainability  \nPosition Paper \n3 \n \n \n \n \nDocument name \nValid from  \nSecurity class \nVolvo Cars Position on Responsible Sourcing  \n2025-01-17 \nPublic  \nVolvo Cars Position on Responsible Sourcing  \nPurpose of this document \nThe overall intention of Volvo Cars\u2019 position papers is to provide clarity to stakeholders on areas of high \nrelevance to the company considering our ambitions and long-term strategies. This paper addresses \nthe challenges linked to responsible sourcing and describes how Volvo Cars works to manage related \nrisks within our global supply chains. Furthermore, this paper outlines our aim to ensure that the \nmaterials used in our products are sourced responsibly and do not contribute to armed conflict, human \nrights abuses, or environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. \nBackground and challenge \nThe acceleration of electric vehicle (EV) production is crucial for the transition to a low-carbon \neconomy. However, a typical electric car requires more critical material inputs (meaning materials with \nhigh economic importance and high supply risk) compared to a conventional car. Material extraction, \nprocessing, trade, and transportation may cause or contribute to adverse impacts for people and \nplanet, for example child or forced labour, money laundering, pollution, and deforestation. Risks are \nespecially prevalent for materials from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). Hence, risk-\nbased supply chain due diligence is necessary to enable responsible sourcing1. \nVolvo Cars position \nVolvo Cars aim to protect and improve people\u2019s lives in our value chain and wider society. We \ncontinuously monitor and assess risks to verify that Volvo Cars\u2019 business operations and products do \nnot induce human rights abuses, unethical business conduct, environmental harm, or provide funding \nto conflicts and armed groups. Volvo Cars has identified several minerals, metals, and bio-based \nmaterials associated with considerable environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks, which we \nrefer to as \u201cRaw Materials of Concern\u201d (RMoC). Targeted due diligence efforts are rolled out gradually \nfor these supply chains to enable responsible sourcing practices. Volvo Cars recognises a broad set of \nESG risks, including but not limited to: \n \n\u2022 \nThe OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-\nAffected and High-Risk Areas Annex II risks; and \n\u2022 \nthe risks related to materials in the Annex X.1 of the EU Batteries Regulation 2023 (EU-Batt-\nR), the social and environmental risk categories stipulated in its Annex X.2, and the \ninternational instruments covering these risks, as referenced in the EU-Batt-R Annex X.3.  \n \nWe are committed to respecting and complying with international instruments, principles and \nframeworks such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the \nInternational Bill of Human Rights including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO core \n\n \n \n \nconventions, the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, and the OECD \nGuidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We develop and implement procurement practices using a \nrisk-based approach in line with global standards and require our suppliers to also implement and \nmaintain appropriate policies, management systems, and due diligence measures to identify, prevent \nand mitigate any adverse impacts linked to their business via their own operations or via their \nrelationships with third parties. Our approach to human rights due diligence is detailed in our Human \nRights Statement. \n \nOur Business Partners shall implement the standards and principles set out in our Code of Conduct for \nBusiness Partners or same principles, with all applicable laws and regulations, and with their \ncontractual obligations to Volvo Cars, including our Sustainability Requirements, throughout its \norganisation and extend the requirements to its value chain, ensuring that its Employees, \nsubcontractors and other relevant third parties comply with said standards and principles. Violation or \nlack of cooperation, failure to address violations or take timely actions may lead to claims, a loss of \nbusiness and ultimately to the end of the business relationship with Volvo Cars. \n \nVolvo Cars acknowledges that supply chain due diligence is an ongoing, proactive, and reactive \nprocess, and that information and risk monitoring systems will progressively be improved over time as \na result from constructive engagement with suppliers and other stakeholders.   \n \nConflict minerals: \nVolvo Cars is", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Investors \nrecognise that environmental stress, social pressures \nand governance structures can play a material role \nin determining risk and return and are aware of the \nrole they play in promoting sustainable business \npractices in financial markets.  \nIt is my pleasure to introduce Nordea Asset \nManagement\u2019s Annual Responsible Investment \nReport for 2016. As we enter our tenth year as \na signatory to the Principles for Responsible \nInvestment (PRI), I am very proud of the steps \nwe have taken to take a wider view of ESG \n(Environment, Social and Governance) issues \nand account for them in our investment activities. \nDelivering returns with responsibility is part of our \nmission as the largest Nordic asset manager with \nan increasing European presence and business. \nNot only do we recognise the potential challenges \nand opportunities presented by ESG factors to our \nclient\u2019s assets, but also see the increasing demand \nfrom our clients to integrate these factors in our \ninvestment decision making, ownership practices \nand product offering. This is a constant journey \nand we will continue to evolve our differentiated \napproach to responsible investment.\nIn 2016 the World Economic Forum identified failure \nof climate change mitigation and adaptation, water \ncrises and profound social instability within the \ntop five global risks of highest concern for the next \n10 years.  These are issues that not only present \nchallenges for countries, but present risks and \nopportunities for the entities in which we invest, and \nultimately the assets we manage. For Nordea Asset \nManagement, we believe company engagement \nis critical in our action as investors. In 2016 we \ncontinued our commitments and ambitions to \naddress these areas:\n\u2022 \u0007Climate Change; By the end of 2016, the required \nnumber of countries that produce enough of \nthe world\u2019s greenhouse gases signed the Paris \nAgreement in order for it to enter into force.  To \nremain competitive, companies and investors \nwill need to understand how the Agreement \nwill affect markets, regulation, and operations \n- and take corresponding action. We are part of \nseveral investor initiatives that support corporate \nresilience in a low-carbon universe and we are \nproud of our collaborative achievements in 2016 \nin seeking enhanced climate disclosure by the \nentities in which we invest. \n\u2022 \u0007Water; Given the magnitude of global water \ncrises, the societal impacts and the operational \nconstraints it poses for companies and their \nsuppliers, we lived one of our \u201cproudest moments\u201d \nwhen we, as active investors, were able to increase \nawareness of and action on reducing water \npollution in the pharmaceutical industry supply \nchain.\n  \n\u2022 \u0007Human Rights; Businesses benefit from a stable \nsocial and political environment for running their \noperations and respect for human rights issues is \nessential to this.

Voordat een \ngeneesmiddel een handelsvergunning krijgt en op de markt mag worden \ngebracht, moet eerst worden aangetoond dat de kwaliteit, veiligheid en \nwerkzaamheid voldoende zijn. Dit is geen eenmalige gebeurtenis maar gebeurt \ncontinu gedurende de tijd dat het geneesmiddel op de markt is. De maatregelen \ndie hiervoor nodig zijn, zijn erg omvangrijk geworden en hebben effect op \ninnovatie, kosten en de beschikbaarheid van geneesmiddelen. Daardoor leeft \nzowel binnen de overheid als de maatschappij de vraag of dit systeem \ntoekomstbestendig is. \n \nHet RIVM heeft daarom de knelpunten van het huidige systeem in kaart \ngebracht. Het blijkt dat de vier belangrijke thema\u2019s van het systeem (veiligheid \n& effectiviteit, kosten, innovatie en beschikbaarheid) nauw met elkaar \nsamenhangen. Een verandering binnen een van de thema\u2019s raakt altijd aan de \nandere, en een optimale balans is lastig te bepalen. Zo zorgen soepelere regels \nom innovatie te stimuleren ervoor dat geneesmiddelen sneller op de markt \nbeschikbaar zijn. Als keerzijde daarvan is er minder kennis over de veiligheid en \neffectiviteit op het moment dat een vergunning wordt verleend. Extra \nveiligheidsmaatregelen leiden daarentegen tot langere studies, en daarmee tot \nhogere kosten voor (de ontwikkeling van) geneesmiddelen en een beperktere \nbeschikbaarheid.  \n \nBovendien hebben factoren buiten het geneesmiddelensysteem invloed op de \nvier thema\u2019s, zoals commerci\u00eble belangen en de besluitvorming over de \nnationale vergoeding van geneesmiddelen. Ook ontbreekt op meerdere terreinen \ntransparantie, bijvoorbeeld in de opbouw van kosten of de uitwisseling van data.  \n \nAangezien belangen per partij verschillen (van industrie, tot verzekeraars, \npati\u00ebnten en zorgprofessionals), is het lastig om een balans te vinden die alle \npartijen tevreden stelt. Bij eventuele aanpassingen aan het systeem is het van \nbelang hiermee rekening te houden. Pati\u00ebnten met een ernstige ziekte waarvoor \nnog geen behandeling beschikbaar is, zullen bijvoorbeeld meer risico\u2019s \naccepteren \nop \nhet \ngebied \nvan \nveiligheid \nen \neffectiviteit \ndan \ngeneesmiddelenbeoordelaars of het algemene publiek. \n \n \n\nRIVM Report  \n Page 4 of 77 \nAbstract \nMinds Open \u2013 sustainability of the European regulatory system for \nmedicinal products.  \n \nThe European system for the production, authorization and marketing of \nmedicinal products is strongly regulated. Medicines have to meet predetermined \nstandards concerning safety, quality and efficacy before they are granted market \nauthorization. Safeguarding these standards does not stop at the moment of \nmarket authorization. During the time an authorized medicinal product is \navailable on the market, it is subject to a continuous process of surveillance.  \nThe regulation supporting this process of continuous surveillance has expanded \nincreasingly and is affecting the amount of innovation of new medicinal \nproducts, the availability and the costs of medicinal products. Against this \nbackground, the question whether the current regulatory system for medicinal \nproducts is still sustainable in future has come to the fore. \n \nThe RIVM analyzed potential vulnerabilities in the current regulatory system with \na focus on the themes safety & efficacy, innovation, costs and availability of \n(new) medicinal products. \nThis report shows that these themes show a strong interdependency and cannot \nbe separated easily. Interventions in one theme will have an effect on another \ntheme or even on multiple themes; e.g. more attention to safety and efficacy \nwill lead to higher costs and a decline in both innovation and availability of \nmedicinal products. The four main themes can be seen as four gear wheels. \nWhen one wheel is being turned, the others are also set in motion.  \n \nFurthermore, during this study the themes \u2018transparency\u2019 and \u2018accountability\u2019 \nwere also found to be important.

We calculate \nour scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and \nCorporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol). In so far as possible, any known deviations from \nthe GHG Protocol are documented.  \n \nOrganisational boundary \nSustainability performance data is collected from across our global operations on an operational control basis. We aim to account for \n100% of the data from wholly owned operations and subsidiaries; majority owned jointly controlled entities and associates, where we \nhave an equity stake of \u226551%; and minority owned jointly controlled entities and associates, where we have an equity stake of \u226450% \nand retain management control.  \n \nAcquisitions and divestments \nWe aim to fully integrate any acquired entities from our data collection, consolidation and reporting processes within the first \ncalendar year following acquisition. For divested entities that are financially classified as \u201cdiscontinued operations\u201d (divested or held \nfor sale), all current year and historical performance data, including normalised data from the discontinued operation, will be excluded \nfrom the consolidation process for the reporting year in which the divestment took place, with the exception of disclosure within our \nStreamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) statement. For any divested entities that are not financially classified as \ndiscontinued operations, performance data will be included in current year up to the time of sale completion.  In subsequent \nreporting years all data including historical and normalised data from the divested entity will be excluded from the consolidation \nprocess. Where an acquisition or divestment is material, with the inclusion or removal of the entity\u2019s data results in a variation that \nexceeds \u00b1 5% of the original, historical data will be restated where attainable. We aim to restate data for a minimum of two years prior \nto acquisition or divestment, which may include restating target baselines where appropriate. \n \nReporting period \nThe reporting period for our sustainability performance metrics is aligned to our financial reporting period, from 1 January through to \n31 December. Where it is not possible to provide complete data within this timeframe, for example due to a lag in energy invoicing for \nscope 1 + 2 emissions calculations, then actual data is collected for the period from January to October inclusive. This is then adjusted \nto the full reporting period through the application of an appropriate adjustment factor.  \n \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022 ROLLS-ROYCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS  \n\u2022 BASIS OF REPORTING  \n\n \nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BASIS OF REPORTING | Published 1st March 2023 \nData quality \nThe aim of our reporting processes is to provide data that is complete, accurate and relevant to our operations.

The 17 political goals are intended to promote sustainable development world-\nwide at the economic, social, and environmental levels and are aimed not only at governments worldwide, but \nalso at civil society, the private sector, and academia. Through its business activities, Sartorius particularly con-\ntributes to the achievement of nine of the global sustainability goals. The focus is on goal number 3 for \u201cgood \nhealth and well-being,\u201d which is addressed by the company\u2019s business model.  \n \nSartorius operates in the life science sector \u2013 more precisely, in the field of medical biotechnology. As a partner \nto the biopharmaceutical industry, the Group manufactures products and process technologies that are used \nin the development and production of biological medicines and vaccines. In this context, the Group places a \nparticular focus on innovations that make it possible to increase the safety, speed, and efficiency of the devel-\nopment and production process for such active ingredients. This allows new therapies to be made available to \npatients earlier, at lower prices, and to a larger number of patients.  \nThe biopharmaceutical industry plays a crucial role in the development of new drugs and vaccines to prevent \nand treat diseases, some of which were previously incurable. In this way, it improves the lives of patients world-\nwide. For example, the use of recombinant antibodies has reduced mortality in patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s \nlymphoma by approximately one quarter and doubled the survival rate among patients with metastatic ski", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The demand for ESG data and services is surging among investors and asset managers looking \nfor sustainable investments. ESG data plays an important role in matching supply and demand for \nsustainable investment and in facilitating the transition to a more sustainable economy, allowing the \noptimal allocation of capital to cleaner companies and infrastructures. DBG truly appreciates the efforts \nby IOSCO, in particular the in-depth analysis and insights provided, as well as the willingness to listen to \nindustry and stakeholders. From the conversations we have had in various fora, it is our understanding \nthat addressing this topic with a global approach is of key importance, and potential policy responses \nacross jurisdictions must be coordinated, hence we see an evident role of IOSCO in this regard. \nWe hope that sharing our experiences and practices will provide added value in addition to IOSCOs \nanalytical work by contributing from a provider perspective. Therefore, we will in some instances within \nour response explain in a rather granular way how business is set up, which best practices already exist to \nensure data quality/good governance/address market demands etc. \nDue to the complementary nature of our businesses within our Group we aim offer a unique perspective \nto IOSCO and the broader interested audience covering a wide range of IOSCO\u2019s recommendations: \n\u2022 \ndirected to ESG service providers through our ESG data, analytics and service provider \nInstitutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) in which we hold a majority stake, \n\u2022 \ndirected to users of ESG services through our analytics and index provider Qontigo and our \nderivatives exchange Eurex, as well as \n\u2022 \nfrom a preparer perspective through our own Group reporting. \n \nISS ESG, the responsible investment arm of ISS, is the world\u2019s leading provider of environmental, social, \nand governance solutions for more than 1,100 global clients spanning asset owners, asset managers, \nhedge funds, and asset servicing providers. ISS ESG delivers differentiated sustainability services and a \nsuite of solutions to its clients, drawing on a team of more than 460 global professionals with thematic \n\n \n2 \n \nPublic \nand sector expertise that underpin our commitment to sustainable finance. With more than 35 years of \ncorporate governance expertise and 25 years of providing in-depth responsible investment research and \nanalytics to include a dedicated global climate research team, ISS ESG has a unique understanding of the \nrequirements of institutional investors. With its comprehensive offering of solutions, ISS ESG enables \ninvestors to develop and integrate responsible investing policies and practices, thoughtfully engage \nportfolio companies on responsible investment issues, and monitor their practices through screening \nsolutions. It also provides climate data, analytics, and advisory services to help financial market \nparticipants understand, measure, and act on climate-related risks across all asset classes. In addition, ISS \nESG delivers corporate and country ESG research and ratings, enabling its clients to identify material social \nand environmental risks and opportunities. \nIn addition, as one of the largest providers of market infrastructure worldwide, DBG offer a broad range \nof products and services. For example, we develop market leading ESG indices and analytics solutions via \nour subsidiary Qontigo (with its brands STOXX, DAX, Axioma) and offer ESG derivatives via our derivatives \nexchange Eurex. \nLast but not least, Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG as a listed company reports ESG information and is subject to ESG \nratings itself.

We have \na diversified portfolio of assets and our commercial \nproperty portfolio has performed well and we \ninvested another \u00a33.5 million in these assets during \n2022. Overall however, we have experienced a fall in \nthe value of our underlying investments.\nThis reduction in value came at a time when interest \nrates began to increase. The challenge, therefore \nhas been to continue to provide competitive returns \nfor our members in this environment. I am pleased \nthat given these challenges we have been able to \ndeclare our interim rates. I would like to thank all our \nteam at Sheffield Mutual; both employees and Board \nmembers in producing this result.\nThere are many factors to take into account when \nconsidering an investment. One element is the \nadvertised initial return but there are of course other \nconsiderations. At Sheffield Mutual we aim to provide \nour members with an attractive investment over the \nlong term. We provide an excellent level of customer \nservice and a member of our team is always available \nduring the day to assist. We know that our members \nvalue this service from the ratings on our website. \nIt is this service which makes us stand out from our \ncompetitors.\nWe have continued work over the year on developing \nour website. During 2022 we have been working on \nthe construction of the member portal and several \ntranches of that work have been completed. Work will \ncontinue during 2023. Our objective is to provide a \nwebsite which ultimately gives increased functionality \nto members such as viewing balances, statements \nand updating details.\nThere have been significant changes over the \nyear in our own office property. When 2022 began \nthere was not sufficient room at the head office \nto accommodate all of our staff and our Board \nmeetings, which were held offsite. I am delighted to \nsay we have been able to take an extra floor of space \nin the upper unit adjoining our existing property. \nOver the year works have continued to integrate the \nnew space into our existing accommodation. The \nresult is a new open plan space for our staff, and \nmeetings are now able to take place at head office. \nI do consider that it is important for Board members \nto see our working environment and chat informally \nwith our staff. This expansion facilitates that goal.\nWe have been working over the year to commence \nimplementation of the FCA\u2019s Consumer Duty which \napplies to all regulated firm", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Turning pledges and commitments \ninto real action requires effort; however, it is essential now that the scale of the problem is better understood, \nand the solutions made clearer. \nWe might well wish for a more stable geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop for what is a substantial task. \nBut we can\u2019t afford to let the urgent distract from the existential and wait for conditions to improve.\nWith that in mind, and to sharpen our analysis of the progress made by our investee companies, we have \nenhanced our proprietary sustainability ratings to include assessments of both the financial, and non-financial \nimpacts, of company actions. This is what is known as \u2018double materiality\u2019 and it is crucial to compiling a \nforward-looking view on the sustainability profiles of corporate issuers. \nAsset managers have a choice to engage or divest, or a combination of both. As active managers, we have \npreferred to engage with companies where their transition plans fall short. Getting from brown to green is the \npriority, not just in portfolios but in aggregate across the world. To that end we are employing a climate rating to \nidentify the companies with whom we should prioritise engagement to meet our net zero goals.\nBy working with other investors in this area, through groups such as Climate Action 100+, we can share \nknowledge and investment policies, engaging directly with management to focus improvements on areas that \nneed it most.\nFinally, sustainable investing is as important to private markets as public ones. Private markets give investors \naccess to those smaller-scale firms working on green technology to reshape industries, as well as renewable \nenergy projects. \nSustainability is complex and, like most areas of finance, constantly evolving. It requires us to iterate our own \nprocesses to keep pace with change and ensure our investment ambitions remain high. \nAnne Richards \nCEO, Fidelity International\n\nOverview: ESG 2.0\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n06\nSection 1: ESG integration at Fidelity   \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n11\n     2021 update\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n\t\n13\n     Ratings 2.0\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n       \t15\n     High impact\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n       \t20\n     Allocating for climate change  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n       22\nSection 2: Active ownership at Fidelity  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n24\n     Engagement in 2021\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n             \t 26 \n     Voting in 2021\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n\t\n\t\n       27\t\n     Sustainable investing themes \t\t\n \t\n\t\n\t\n           \t 28\n     Environment \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n   \t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n    \t 30 \n\t\nClimate\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n        \t \t\n31\n\t\nNature\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n        \t \t\n40\n     Social \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n   \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n    \t 46 \n\t\nEmployees \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n        ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

(SG) is a global systematically important bank and one of the 10 \nlargest European banks with close to \u20ac1.5 trillion in assets and 67% of its risk \nexposure in France and Western Europe in 2021. Headquartered in Paris, the bank is \ngeographically diversified, with a presence in 66 countries and serving 25 million \nclients globally. In the first nine months of 2022, SG generated close to \u20ac21.2 billion \nin net banking income, balanced between its three core businesses: French retail \nbanking (30% of income in 2021); international retail banking and financial services \nto corporates (31%); and global banking and investors solutions (37%). \nOur ESG Evaluation score of 79 reflects the bank's meaningful efforts to integrate \nESG considerations into its lending and financing activities. SG has been \nstrengthening its climate commitments, including in renewable energy financing and \naims to align its financing portfolios to a 1.5-degree Celsius pathway by 2050. Its \naction plan includes phasing out coal, excluding hydrocarbons such as shale oil and \noil sands, and reducing exposure to the most material carbon-intensive sectors. \nWhile implementation of the ESG integration framework is not yet systematic, the \nbank is actively strengthening its process for a comprehensive coverage of all large \ncorporates. On that, we view favorably the ESG-by-design project to develop \nprocesses and tools to monitor SG\u2019s sustainability engagements. We highlight the \nbank's strong performance on customer engagement, capitalizing on the digitization \ntrend with Boursorama. We consider France\u2019s protectionary framework regarding \ndebt overburden risks for customers, notably with the usury rate and fixed rates. \nSG exhibits strong preparedness to navigate and adapt to disruptive trends. The \nboard has demonstrated its excellent awareness of long-term risks and \nopportunities that go beyond sustainability. Furthermore, we credit the board\u2019s \nability to embed emerging trends into strategic decision-making. The board\u2019s \ndecision-making has shown itself to be guided by long-term thinking through its early \nactivity to support renewable financing and to expand its vehicle leasing business.  \nPRIMARY ANALYST \nMaxime Chul \nParis  \n+33-610-450-098 \nmaxime.chul \n@spglobal.com \nSECONDARY ANALYST \nPhilippe Raposo \nParis \n+33-144-207-377 \nPhilippe.raposo \n@spglobal.com \nRESEARCH CONTRIBUTOR \nSalaheddine Soumir \nParis \nSreenidhi Hegde \nPune \nESG Profile Components (figures subject to rounding) \nESG Profile 74 \n \nEntity-specific \nassessment \nSector/region \nanalysis \nAchieved and  \nattainable scores \nPreparedness +5 \nLow \nEmerging \nAdequate \nStrong \nBest in \nclass \nE (30%) \n37 + E (30%) \n35 = E \n \nESG Evaluation \n79 \n \nS (30%) \n34 + S (30%) \n36 = S \nG (40%) \n46 + G (40%) \n34 = G \n \n   \n \n \n \nEntity within its primary \nsector/region \nEntity\u2019s sectors/ regions \nversus all sectors/ regions \nMin and max scores possible given sectors/regions.

This obstacle can be overcome by\nimplementing Industry 4.0 technologies, which enable real-time data, data authentication, prediction,\ntransparency, authentication, and structured data. Based on the review of previous studies, it was\ndetermined that only a few studies discussed the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies for\nESG data and evaluation. The objective of the study is to discuss the signi\ufb01cance of ESG data and\nreport, which is used for the evaluation of the sustainability of an organization. In this regard,\nthe assimilation of Industry 4.0 technologies (Internet of Things (IoT), arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI),\nblockchain, and big data for obtaining ESG data by an organization is detailed presented to study the\nprogress of advancement of these technologies for ESG. On the basis of analysis, this study concludes\nthat consumers are concerned about the ESG data, as most organizations develop inaccurate ESG\ndata and suggest that these digital technologies have a crucial role in framing an accurate ESG report.\nAfter analysis a few vital conclusions are drawn such as ESG investment has bene\ufb01ted from AI\ncapabilities, which previously relied on self-disclosed, annualized company information that was\nsusceptible to inherent data issues and biases. Finally, the article discusses the vital recommendations\nthat can be implemented for future work.\nKeywords: ESG; sustainability; SDGs; Industry 4.0; IoT; arti\ufb01cial intelligence; big data; ESG reporting\n1. Introduction\nThe United Nations laid out the SDGs in 2015 to achieve global sustainability by\n2030 [1]. States, individuals, and investors are increasingly aware that \ufb01rms can play a\nsigni\ufb01cant role in addressing societal issues, and the world still is on track to meet the UN\nSDGs for 2030 [2]. ESG factors are progressively being infused into investment and business\nmanagement because of their potential to develop superior productivity and longer-term\npro\ufb01t growth [3].

Additionally, \ninformation on how sustainability is governed at Reckitt and the \nprinciples that lie behind it are published on our website.\nOur governance framework remains broadly unchanged in 2022,  \nwith effective forums across the business responsible for overseeing \nprogress and ensuring sustainability considerations are embedded \ninto our decision-making. \nAt Board level\nOur Board of Directors is collectively responsible for the overall \nleadership of the Group and for promoting its long-term sustainable \nsuccess while focusing on its strategic direction, Purpose, values \nand governance. The Board has regular discussions about the risks \nand opportunities for the Company and conduct a formal review of \nthe Group\u2019s principal risks at least once a year. Sustainability itself, \nincluding the key issue of climate change, is considered one of the \nCompany\u2019s principal risks. This reflects the continued growth in \nimportance of sustainability and its central role in the Company\u2019s \ngrowth strategy. \nThe Board delegates regular management of sustainability \nrelated matters to a sub-committee, the Corporate Responsibility, \nSustainability, Ethics and Compliance Committee (CRSECC). The \nCommittee meets quarterly to review our progress against our \nsustainability strategy, and performance against our targets. \nMeetings are attended by the CEO, who has accountability for \nsustainability performance at executive level. He is joined at the \nmeetings by various members of the Group Executive Committee, \nincluding the Chief Marketing, Sustainability & Corporate Affairs \nOfficer and other senior executives. A summary of the matters \ndiscussed by the CRSECC during 2022 is available in the CRSECC \nReport within the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts (pages 120-125).\nAt managerial level\nOur managerial oversight of sustainability reflects the structure  \nof our business as one Group with three business units. We have  \na single committee for the Group as a whole, the Risk, Sustainability \nand Compliance Committee (RSCC), chaired by our CEO. This is \nsupported by business unit-level committees, which report up to  \nthe RSCC and share information with the CRSECC. These committees \nall meet and report quarterly on sustainability issues and risks, \nincluding performance against targets to enable their ongoing \noversight of activity.\nThe RSCC reviews risks and our progress in managing them, and \ncovers all of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) activity. \nThis includes, for example, reviewing the management of, and \nresponses to, issues flagged through our Speak Up whistle-blowing \nsystems, alongside our social impact programme and progress \ntowards our climate ambitions.  \nWithin the business, our Corporate Affairs & Sustainability function \nleads strategy development and compliance, while programmes are \nimplemented by our Brands, Supply Chain, R&D, and Safety, Quality \nand Regulatory Compliance teams. All functions are represented at, \nand are overseen by, the Executive Committee. With the creation of \nthe new role of Chief Marketing, Sustainability & Corporate Affairs \nOfficer in 2022, the connection between brand purpose, consumer-\nfacing activity and the delivery of our sustainability programmes is \nconsolidated within a single function. This strengthens our ability \nto deliver impact through our purpose-led brands, while also \ndemonstrating sustainability to consumers who wish to support \nmore sustainable brands. \nChris Sinclair\nChair of the \nBoard\nPam Kirby\nNon-Executive \nDirector \n(CRSECC Chair)\nNicandro Durante\nChief Executive \nOfficer\nRisk,  \nSustainability \n and Compliance \nCommittee (RSCC)\nHealth GBU\nHealth Risk  \n& Compliance \nReview Meeting\nHygiene GBU\nHygiene Risk  \n& Compliance \nReview Meeting\nNutrition GBU\nNutrition Risk  \n& Compliance \nReview Meeting\nGreater China & \neCommerce GBU\n Risk &  \nCompliance  \nReview Manon \nBoard Meeting\n Risk & Compliance  \nReview  \neCommerce \nLeadership Team\nMehmood Khan\nNon-Executive \nDirector\nOlivier Bouhan\nNon-Executive \nDirector\n02\n\nReckitt\u2002  \t\nInsights 2022\nSUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE, REPORTING AND ASSURANCE CONTINUED\nReporting\nWe are committed to being transparent and believe that publicly \nreporting on sustainability is fundamental to our ability to deliver our \nstrategy.

A fight to make \naccess to the highest quality hygiene, wellness and nourishment a right \nand not a privilege; a fight to make the daily necessities of information \nand products promoting good health and hygiene available to us all. That \nis why in 2020 we also launched our Fight for Access Fund, to ringfence \nan annual investment equivalent to 1% of adjusted operating profit to \nimprove access to high-quality products, providing education and \ninformation, and driving availability. \nNo year could have demonstrated this truth better than 2020, with  \nthe devastating effects COVID-19 has had on health and livelihoods  \nall around the world. The pandemic naturally led to a huge increase  \nin demand for our disinfectant brands like Dettol and Lysol, hygiene \nOur Compass\nRejuvenating growth, sustainably\nReckitt\u2019s purpose is to protect, heal and nurture \nin the relentless pursuit of a cleaner and \nhealthier world. It\u2019s the basis of our business \nstrategy, delivered through our three business \nunits \u2013 while our sustainability agenda frames \nour ambition to make the greatest positive \nimpact we can on society and the planet.\n \nOur purpose\nTo protect, heal and nurture in the relentless pursuit  \nof a cleaner, healthier world.\nOur fight\nMaking access to the highest quality hygiene, wellness  \nand nourishment a right, not a privilege.\nprotection being the first step in reducing transmission. Our immediate \npriority was to help people by keeping our operations running safely and \nmaking a huge amount of extra product available. And we played our \npart in getting the hygiene message out through one of the largest \npublic health education campaigns in history. \nDettol\u2019s #HandWashChallenge, which encouraged people to wash their \nhands, started in India in April and by November 2020 had generated \nmore than 125 billion views around the world. This was no traditional \npublic health campaign. Using TikTok, it invited people to create their \nown dance moves around washing their hands, set to a bespoke \nsoundtrack with a branded Dettol banner.\nSocietal impact through our purpose-led brands\u2026 \nThis is a core example of Reckitt\u2019s philosophy of empowering people to \nimprove their own hygiene, wellbeing and nutrition. It\u2019s why all our brands \nare increasingly following a purpose-led path, starting with innovation, \nwhich maximises the benefits to consumers while balancing the wider \nimpacts we have on society. Many of our brands already champion an \nissue which is authentically and meaningfully connected with the \nproduct. For example, Vanish and its partnership with British Fashion \nWeek, promotes cleaning and reusing clothes while Dettol and Harpic \nfocus on water and sanitation for health and hygiene.\nOur bold ambition by 2030 is to reach half the world with brands that \nhelp people live cleaner, healthier lives and enable a cleaner, healthier \nworld. We also aim to engage two billion people each year to make a \npositive societal impact, through our partnerships, programmes and \ncampaigns. Whether through our brands or our Fight for Access Fund,  \nor our value chain, the impacts we create contribute towards delivering \nthe UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \nAnd our target by 2022 is for all of our global brands to deliver on their \npurpose and build connected causes, aligned with the SDGs, that we \nshould fight for, and ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

This new approach brings \ntogether PwC\u2019s unique combination of people, powered by \ntechnology, to deliver on the intertwined needs of trust and sustained \noutcomes that our clients and wider society are seeking in this time of \nprofound change and uncertainty. \nAs competition and societal expectations grow more intense both in \nSingapore and around the world, environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) has assumed an increasingly important role as \norganisations seek to deliver sustainable outcomes more than just \nshort-term solutions.\nIn a signi\ufb01cant step toward achieving our net zero greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions commitment by 2030, our climate targets and \ntimeline have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative \n(SBTi). In alignment with SBTi\u2019s highest ambition level, PwC is \ncommitted to decarbonising the way we operate and decoupling our \nbusiness growth from emissions. \nSustainability Report  |  3\nWe are particularly proud to have launched our Asia Paci\ufb01c Centre for Sustainability Excellence (CSE) \nsupported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, which aims to help organisations across Asia \nPaci\ufb01c achieve ESG excellence through decarbonisation, climate risk management, sustainable \ufb01nance and \ninvestment, sustainability reporting and assurance, and other measures. Together with this Centre, we have \nalso launched the Singapore Low Carbon Network (SLCN) to bring together organisations across Singapore \nthat share ambitions to decarbonise, and advance the sharing of best practices and insights on key carbon \nmeasurement and decarbonisation topics. We look forward to sharing more on this in the next issue of our \nSustainability Report.\nIn our 2022 \ufb01nancial year, we will be setting new carbon emission reduction targets, taking much bolder \nsteps in lowering our emissions, and boosting our performance in ESG through our ESG framework that \ninvolves six key strategies - focus on our net zero commitment, a circular supply chain, strategic \npartnerships, inclusion, diversity and wellbeing of our people, creating an ESG conscious workforce, and \nimpact-driven community outreach. We are also upskilling our people in this area and empowering them to \nbe part of our climate action journey. This will be an extension of our continued e\ufb00orts and progress \nachieved through initiatives such as using 100% renewable energy for electricity along with  o\ufb00setting \n100% of our air travel for the past three years, while supporting our stakeholders with their ESG \ntransformation journey. \nOur people are our biggest success factor and it is vital that we create a safe, inclusive and supportive \nenvironment for them - one which empowers them to be well mentally, physically, socially, emotionally and \n\ufb01nancially. As we transition to endemic living, it is important that we continue to help our people remain \nresilient while ensuring that they have meaningful and sustainable careers.\nThe past year has also shone a spotlight on wellness.

IDENTITY AND STRATEGY\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\n\nLetter to Stakeholders\n2022 has been a difficult year. Despite a significant growth in the top line, \nmarginality has suffered.\nThe increase of raw material costs has not reflected timely and fully \nin consequent prices raise on the market, and we have not been \nable to mitigate the gap through operational excellence. On \ncontrary, we have recognized several disruptions in supply \nchain, leading in missing components which have jeopardized \nour delivery performance. In addition to this critical situation, \nfew production bottlenecks, not helping the overall score with \ncustomers, have surfaced. \nBooking trend has been quite strong, also due to an abnormal \ndilatation of lead times.\n2023 will be the year of inverting the trend on marginality. Thanks to \ncapacity issues being addressed and general improvements in the whole \nsupply chain, top line will continue to grow but at a slower pace and on time delivery \nwill become a sane obsession. We shall embrace and leverage our fundamentals, quality and customization, to \nconcentrate on operational excellence and rigorous costs control, guarantying value creation to our customers \nand reaffirming our strong positioning in the market as partner of choice for electrical motors and integrated \nautomated solutions.\nWith a view to continuous improvement, we have set ourselves the goal of outlining a path of growth in \nsustainability, reflecting both our commitment to sustainable development and the growing strategic importance \nwe attach to ESG issues. \nIn fact, during the year 2022 Lafert confirmed his commitment and sensitivity towards these issues not only by \nfollowing up the Sustainability Report for the year 2021 but elaborating his first Home-Work Travel Plan (or \nHWTP) with a view to reducing CO2 emissions by identifying alternative measures to use the private car to reach \nthe workplace. \nSustainability has become a daily commitment for Lafert to the point that the company has earned the Ecol Design \nAward 2022, a recognition created to reward the most virtuous companies that are committed to the sustainability \nof their activities and their plants by taking all possible measures to improve their environmental impact.\nIn this context, the renewal of the Group\u2019s Code of Ethics and Conduct, as well as the implementation of a Code \nof Ethics addressed to suppliers (whose subscription is in the process of being signed) redefining the fundamental \nvalues of conduct that inspire and guide the activity not only of all employees of the Lafert Group, but of the entire \nsupply chain; during the year 2022 the Organization, Management and Control Model according to D.lgs. n. \n231/2001 was also made official.\nThe year 2023 is characterized by the same sensitivity: in March the first Lafert Group Sustainability Plan was \napproved by the Board of Directors. This document outlines 82 objectives that we are committed to achieve over \nthe next three years in the environmental, social and governance fields, which can be perfectly expressed in a \nsingle ambitious medium-long-term su", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

The report is \nbeing published at a very special time, not only from the point of view of our company but also from the point \nof view of the entire global economy, society, our employees, their relatives and friends. This is the fifth edition \nof our non-financial report and we are once again closing it at uncertain times. In 2020, the pandemic \npresented a challenge for our organization. Today, we are dealing with Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine. Our \nresponsible approach has been demonstrated by our involvement in the fight against the coronavirus and \nnow by showing our solidarity with Ukraine. Since the very early days of the invasion, we have been offering \nnumerous free telecommunication services to the refugees from Ukraine, and together with ZE PAK we \ndonated  PLN 5 million to \u201cPolsat Foundation for the Children of Ukraine\u201d action.  \nBearing in mind the numerous groups of our stakeholders, I sincerely trust that everyone will find something \nof interest in this report \u2013 from the overview of our business, through the presentation of our Strategy 2023+,   \nto the description of the activities that we embarked upon in the areas of natural environment, the society and \ncorporate governance. This year\u2019s edition of our report covers the Group\u2019s main companies \u2013 Cyfrowy Polsat, \nPolkomtel, TV Polsat and Netia Capital Group. \n2021 was a year of many challenges.

We were able \nto take advantage of favorable market conditions, \nparticularly in North America, and the efficient \ndeployment of our global industrial system to generate \nstrong increases in sales and margins through the year. \nOur sales grew 80% to USD 11.8 billion, our  \nEBITDA rose to USD 3.6 billion, and our net income \nrose to USD 2.5 billion, or 22% of net sales. With a \nsolid balance sheet and good prospects for an increase \nin cash \ufb02ow in the year ahead, we are proposing to \nraise our dividend for the 2022 year by 24% to USD \n0.51 per share. \nWe produced over 3.5 million tons of steel pipes \nworldwide, sustaining an ongoing ramp up of our \nfacilities in the USA and high levels of production \nthroughout our industrial system. Despite the use of \nlonger and more complex production and logistics \nroutes, we were able to maintain high standards for \nsafety, product quality and consumption of materials.\nDuring the year, we hired 6,500 new employees \nand, in our induction training routines, we paid \nclose attention to the importance of having a safety \nmindset with awareness and behaviors suitable for \nthe industrial environment of our shop \ufb02oor. We \nempower all our employees to be proactive in always \ntaking preventive safety actions. Our lost time injury \nfrequency rate for the year declined by 10% to 0.9 \nper million man hours worked. We are grateful to our \npeople working in the plant for their contribution to \nthis result.\nWe increased the deployment of our Rig Direct\u00ae \nservices. We are now serving over 500 rigs directly \nworldwide. Our unique service platform allows us \nto integrate our operations more closely with our \ncustomers, minimizing material production and \ufb02ows, \nand provide digital and technical services that can \nfurther differentiate us from our competitors. \nAs we increased production, sales and service, \nour logistics operations have reached a substantial \nmagnitude. To give an idea of the efforts involved, \nbetween inter-mill transportation and delivery to \ncustomers, we moved around 10 million tons of \nmaterial all around the world. We are strengthening \nthe reliability of our supply chain through the \ndigitalization of our material \ufb02ows.\n2022 marked a turning point in our deployment in \nthe United States. The country accounted for more \nthan 40% of our total sales, most of which are now \nproduced locally. We brought the Bay City mill to full \nproduction capacity and ramped up production in the \nrest of our US industrial system including the restart \nof production of welded pipes and of heat treatment \nand \ufb01nishing at our Baytown and Koppel sites. We \nhired more than 1,500 new employees during the year \nand now employ 3,600 persons in the country. \nChairman\u2019s \nLetter \n\n4\nAs we look ahead, we view that the current balance in \nthe oil market and high demand for LNG will support \noil and gas prices and investment in the sector. We \nexpect that the number of oil and gas wells drilled \naround the world in 2023 will increase and this will \ndrive global OCTG demand to around 16 million tons \nto reach its highest level since 2014.\nWith the increase in activity, we expect further \nsales and cash \ufb02ow growth with increases in sales \nto offshore developments, in the Middle East and in \npipeline infrastructure in South America. \nOur achievements over the past year that will support \nthis growth include: our multi-year agreement with \nExxonMobil to supply their offshore operations in \nGuyana; our agreements with Petrobras to supply \ntheir pre-salt operations; the renewal of our long-\nterm worldwide agreement with ENI; the renewal \nof our long-term agreement with QatarGas and \nthe consolidation of our long-term agreement with \nADNOC. We also extended our long-term agreements \nwith YPF and Pemex and were awarded supply \nagreements for major gas pipeline projects for the \nVaca Muerta \ufb01eld in Argentina and the North Field \nexpansion in Qatar.\nThe sustainability of our operations worldwide \ndepends on the support and development of our local \ncommunities.

The Nestl\u00e9 Corporate Business Principles\nstate openly that we favour long term business development over\nshort term profit. While we are committed to making a healthy\nprofit, we instruct managers not to do so at the expense of long\nterm, sustainable development.\n\nAs we move ahead in the 21st century, we believe\nthat a business strategy based on high-quality food\nand beverage products can only be maintained \nby business practices based on the principles of \nlong term sustainable development. \nIn this report we attempt to describe how we practice\nand implement the principles of sustainable\ndevelopment where we have direct influence and\nimpact on economies, societies and environments.\nFor everyone in our company, our responsibilities and\nvalues are reflected in our commitment to the \nNestl\u00e9 Corporate Business Principles. These set out\nthe basic rules we follow to make sure we maintain \nthe highest standards of conduct. This report\npresents some key performance measures and\nfigures, and shows how we endeavour to put our\nPrinciples into practice. \nIn meeting our commitment to be a leader in\nsustainable development, we build on two \nof the essential pillars of our long term strategy:\ninnovation-renovation and operational efficiency. \nWe innovate in new products and technologies \nto meet the present and future needs of our\nconsumers in an increasingly sustainable manner, \nand we improve or renovate existing products and\ntechnologies for the same reasons. We are dedicated\nto continuous improvement in the efficient use of\nresources, resulting not only in lower operating \ncosts, but also in a lower impact on the environment.\nManaging our activities in accordance with \nthe principles of sustainable development makes\ngood business sense.\nGiven the company\u2019s focus on high quality, food\nsafety, nutritional value, and consumer appeal, Nestl\u00e9\nneeds to purchase high-quality agricultural goods\nproduced in a sustainable way. Even though we own\nno agricultural land, our approach has been, through\ntechnical assistance, to improve the farming methods\nand standard of living of millions of farmers.\nThis is Nestl\u00e9\u2019s initial effort to report on sustainable\ndevelopment, attempting to describe our impact \non the well-being of people and the planet. As such,\nit is a step on a journey, as opposed to an end \npoint in itself. In addition, we have produced more\ndetailed reports, entitled Environment Progress \nReport 2000 and Nestl\u00e9 in the Community, and \nour annual Management Report provides \ndetails on financial performance. You will find\ninformation on these and other publications at the\nend of this report.\nWe are committed to being open and transparent,\nand to listening to the views of others as we move\nforward in sustainable development.

I am \nproud to say that all our teams \nthroughout our regions have \nresponded magnificently; as \nwell as continuing to serve our \ncommunities, we have stayed \ntrue to our commitment to \nsustainable development, \nwhich is an essential part of \nour ambitious vision to become \na leading bottler in the global \nCoca-Cola system. \nThere have been numerous challenges in all \nmarkets where Swire Coca-Cola operates, \nhowever we remain focused on continuing \nto deliver on our 2025 and 2030 sustainable \ndevelopment targets as detailed in our \nsustainability strategy, \u201cOur Choice, Our \nFuture!\u201d. \nThe successful execution of our strategy \ngreatly depends on the People and culture \nembedded in our company. Our continued \nfocus on the safety of our employees \nresulted in a continued reduction in our \ntotal injury rate (TIR) of 3% compared to \nthe previous year. In 2021, we launched our \n\u201cZero is Possible\u201d programme, underpinned \nby a continuous improvement framework, \nwhich emphasises our vision to become a \nzero harm organisation and belief that all \naccidents are avoidable and preventable.\nare determined to continue to invest and \nbring in new technological interventions to \nensure that we exceed these targets.\nDuring these challenging times, it has been \nmore important than ever to continue \nto contribute to, and partner with, the \nCommunities in which we operate. In 2021, \nwe invested over HK$15 million (0.6% of \nour annual profit), in various community \nactivities across all our markets. We also \ncontinued to meet the changing needs \nof our consumers by providing a greater \nvariety of drinks with more low and no-\nsugar options and continue to develop \nProduct packaging that is fully recyclable \nand with increased recycled PET content. \nAs the world emerges and recovers from \nthe pandemic there is still uncertainty and \nchallenges that we will all face. One thing \nthat we can be certain about is that Swire \nCoca-Cola is committed to our long-term \nsustainable development strategy and \nwill continue to transparently report our \nprogress. I hope you enjoy reading our 2021 \nSustainable Development Report.\n \nKaren So\nManaging Director\nSwire Coca-Cola Limited\nIn addition to the challenges from the \npandemic, we have also witnessed the \nimpact from Climate change on the \npeople and the communities in which \nwe operate.

Therefore, with this report, we aim to \nprovide an accessible update on how we are tackling \nthe challenges presented by climate change, as well \nas meeting our regulatory requirements aligned to the \nrecommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD).\nThe Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited \n(RPTCL), the corporate Trustee of the railways pension \nschemes, remains focused on our mission to pay \npensions securely, affordably, and sustainably. We are \nsupported in managing climate risks and opportunities \nby our wholly-owned subsidiary, Railway Pension \nInvestments Limited (Railpen). Railpen\u2019s purpose is \n\u2018to secure our members\u2019 future\u2019, and through its \ngovernance and operating arrangements, we ensure \nalignment with the Trustee\u2019s mission, giving us both a \nclear line of sight of our shared objectives.\nBoth the physical impacts of climate change as well \nas the actions taken to mitigate those impacts, are \nfinancially material for pension schemes. This is why \nwe must try to understand the risks and opportunities \nclimate presents to our schemes, and adapt the way \nwe manage the schemes accordingly. Importantly, \nthe analysis in this report demonstrates that the best \nclimate outcome for the schemes would be where \nthe world meets the goals of the Paris Agreement in \nan orderly and just fashion. This has benefits for our \nmembers \u2013 both financially and societally \u2013 and is why \nwe continue to dedicate time and effort", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

We articulated four principles and  \n11 underlying goals in that document and, in this \nreport, we\u2019ll be explaining the progress we\u2019ve made.\nProgress in the year\nDuring 2021, we mapped our Scope 1, 2 and \n3 emissions ahead of schedule. We have now \ncommitted, through SBTi to reduce Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions by 46% and Scope 3 by 13% by 2030  \nvs the 2019 Baseline. Our Scope 1 and 2 targets are  \nin line with the very stringent 1.5oC climate pathway.  \nWe decided to set this aggressive target as we have \ndirect control over these emissions. For Scope 3,  \nwe have adopted the 2oC pathway as these are  \nnot in our direct control. \nIn 2021 we are delighted to announce we have \nreduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by \napproximately 50% and therefore 9 years ahead of \ntarget. This achievement was primarily driven by our \npolicy decision in 2019 to buy renewable electricity \nwherever possible. By the end of 2022 all our  \nsites will use renewable electricity.\nLast year, we undertook a comprehensive materiality \nexercise to ensure that our sustainability and ESG \nefforts remain focused on the most salient issues \nfor our stakeholders. The assessment embraced \nthe \u2018double materiality\u2019 concept, considering our \nimpact on society and the environment, in addition \nto financial materiality. The senior management  \nteam were active participants in the exercise.\nOur safety performance through the y", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

Indeed, investors are recognizing that poor ESG \npractices pose environmental, legal, and reputation risks \nthat can damage the company and the bottom line and that \npositive ESG practices can contribute to improved company \nperformance.\nThe US SIF Foundation (the Forum for Sustainable and \nResponsible Investment) estimates that $12 trillion, or \none-fourth, of all professionally managed assets in the \nUnited States incorporated ESG factors at the beginning of \n2018, up 38 percent in two years.1 Investors increasingly \nare aware that companies with strong ESG performance \nhave a better brand image, a more loyal and stable customer \nand employee base, lower cost of capital, better access to \nfinancing and, ultimately, a greater focus on long-term value \ncreation. \nESG issues also matter to an ever-broadening swath \nof stakeholders, including millennials and iGens\u2014who \nare increasingly influential and discerning consumers and \nemployees\u2014and, of course, many of the world\u2019s largest \ninvestment managers. In a recent petition to the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a consortium \nof investors representing over $5 trillion in assets under \nmanagement requested that the SEC initiates rulemaking  \non a comprehensive framework for ESG-related disclosures \nfor public-reporting companies.2 \ntrillion (26%) of \nU.S.-domiciled\nassets \nare managed using sustainability criteria. \nUS SIF, 2018$12.0\n1  \u0007US SIF Foundation, Report on US Sustainable, Responsible and Impact Investing \nTrends, 2018.\n2  \u0007Cynthia A.

And \nI\u2019m pleased to share the results of our collective efforts in \nthis, Trex\u2019s third annual ESG report. \nEnvironmental sustainability is at the core of our \nproducts and operations\nWe strengthened our long-term strategy to convert \nconsumers from the use of wood products to eco-friendly \nTrex composite decking, which is made from 95% recycled \nand reclaimed materials. Our manufacturing process \nupcycles these materials by transforming them into higher-\nvalue products. In 2020, we upcycled more than 900 \nmillion pounds of plastic film and reclaimed wood, most of \nwhich would otherwise be destined for landfills. \nWe made further strides in minimizing the environmental \nimpact of Trex operations even as our company grew. \nNearly all of our factory scrapped boards are recycled \nback into the manufacturing process and used to \nmake new products. Additionally, our ongoing efforts \nto improve energy efficiency in our plants helped \nreduce the company\u2019s energy use related to cooling by \napproximately 40% in 2020.\nWe were honored to receive the 2020 Sustainability \nLeadership Award from Business Intelligence Group \nin recognition of our commitment to environmentally \nresponsible manufacturing, as well as our commercial and \ncommunity recycling programs. Consumers also continue \nto recognize the company\u2019s sustainability benefits, with \nGreen Builder readers in North America voting Trex the \n\u201cgreenest decking\u201d for the 11th straight year in 2021. \nAmid the pandemic, we immediately prioritized our \nemployees\u2019 health and well-being\nOur Crisis Management Team developed a COVID-19 \npandemic response plan that incorporated guidance and \nrequirements from health authorities to continue our \nessential manufacturing operations under safe conditions. \n\nMessage from Our CEO\nAbout Trex\n2020 Highlights\nMaterial Topics\nEnvironment\nPeople\nGovernance\nSASB Index\nAbout This Report\nTrex | 2020 ESG Report\n3\nWe supported our workers in manufacturing \nand office-based roles with revised safe working \narrangements. And, we provided flexible time for \nall employees affected by the COVID-19 pandemic \n\u2014 whether to recover from the virus, safely \nquarantine, look after a family member or \nto manage childcare.\nOur team\u2019s creativity and dedication are \npowering rapid expansion\nDespite the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nwe completed a $200 million multi-year expansion \nprogram in the first half of 2021 that increased \nTrex production capacity by 70% when compared \nto 2019 levels. This is good news not just for our \ncustomers and business but also for our recycling \nefforts. As Trex continues to grow, we will upcycle \nmore reclaimed wood and polyethylene waste \u2014 \nresulting in more plastic film being diverted from \nlandfills and further reducing its environmental \nimpact \u2014 while providing customers with \nsustainable outdoor living options.\nWe foster a culture that upholds the values \nof diversity, equity and inclusion\nWe\u2019re mindful of the need for all Trex employees \nto feel respected and empowered to perform at \ntheir best. In 2020, we focused on identifying \nunconscious bias in Trex\u2019s hiring practices and on \nreimagining our recruitment advertising to reflect \nbroader ethnic and gender diversity. We reviewed \nour compensation practices and were pleased to \nfind no gender pay gap.

Just what does all of this have to do with ESG?  \nOur answer: A great deal. It stands for the \u201cS\u201c in ESG or in \u201cSocial\u201c and, in this specific \ncase, represents the warm and friendly get-together on UBM\u2019s Family Day.\nSo, what exactly is a Family Day?

But that\u2019s no problem \u2013 it\u2019s all part of our social competence. As an \nemployer, we support the community, as a developer we create properties for  \ngenerations to come, and as a company we want to be a good corporate citizen. \nAccepting responsibility for others and for society can also be a lot of fun.\nThe past year was, by far, not nearly as much fun \u2013 from an economic standpoint and \nalso for the environment. We are, without doubt, at a turning point. This is true for our \nsector and also for global warming. 2022 was the second warmest year in Austria since \nthe start of record-keeping. And UBM was, unfortunately, unable to deliver the same \ntop results as in the past two crisis years. With after-tax earnings of 27 million euros, we \ngenerated an impressive plus but fell short of our expectations. However, our financial \nstrength remains intact.

We thoroughly support the Financial \nReporting Council\u2019s work in Stewardship and Governance.\nAs a quality growth, long-term investor, we look for companies that can deliver sustainable \ninvestment returns. We believe that value creation is enhanced when companies deliver social \nutility, while limiting negative impact to the environment. ESG analysis is therefore fully integrated \nwithin our fundamental research on each company and throughout our investment decision-\nmaking process. As active owners, we strive to improve ESG practices through targeted company \nengagements and by voicing our opinions through responsible voting. Importantly, our interests are \nfocused on the long-term and aligned with our clients because of our broad employee partnership \nmodel. \nOver the past year, we have witnessed a sharp increase in the volume of ESG information requested \nby our clients. Our segregated mandate clients are also integrating increasingly bespoke ESG \ntailoring to meet their needs and organisational goals. We continue to add resources to ensure we \ncan meet these demands and add value to our clients in their ESG journeys. In 2023, as a signatory \nto the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative, we published our first climate-related targets.  \nThese targets allow us to both prioritise our engagement resources on companies facing the most \nsignificant climate risks and to assess the sustainability of their business models. \nWe acknowledge that there is a need for ongoing learning and development. We continue to face \na changing regulatory landscape and increasingly bespoke client needs. We have made further \ninvestments in ESG resources, servicing capabilities and operational infrastructure. We are also \ncarefully ensuring that all teams at Comgest absorb and apply ESG knowledge.

Despite all this, we have \nfirmly kept our focus on sustainability. We \nconsider it a main contributor to value cre-\nation for all our stakeholders, as well as a \nmain contributor to fulfilling the expecta-\ntions for future growth and stability of the \ncompany.\nTherefore, we launched the True Green \nInitiative in 2022, a comprehensive pro-\ngram aimed and designed to accelerate \nand integrate sustainability with practical \nactions into everything we do, from pro-\ncesses to attitudes. Furthermore, at the \nbeginning of 2022, we took another ma-\njor step forward in sustainability, as we be-\ncame confirmedly carbon neutral in all \nour own operations, and now only offer  \nzero-emission production and services to \nour customers.\nYet we are raising our ambitions even \nfurther: we have announced our intention \nto meet the high climate standards of the  \nScience-Based Targets Initiative. This is fur-\nther proof of our unwavering commitment \nto sustainability.

{"task": "Guideline alignment", "input": "VERMEER ESG \nSUMMARY\nOctober 2021\n\nWE\u2019RE IN A CONSTANT \nPURSUIT TO FIND A \nBETTER WAY TO DO \nIMPORTANT WORK.\nFor more than 70 years, finding a better way has been a refrain that has inspired the way Vermeer  \ndoes business. Our 4P philosophy (principles, people, product, profit) has set the foundation for \nhow we treat others and the world around us. For the last 25 years, we\u2019ve also been guided by a \nspirit of continuous improvement that has extended through every part of our operations.\nCombining our 4P foundation with our continuous improvement spirit, we strive to make purposeful \nimprovements in environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts as we build, distribute and support \nVermeer equipment doing important work around the world. Taking care of others and the world around us is at \nthe core of our 4P philosophy and has built the culture and brand we are today. As we work with our customers \nwho are equipped with Vermeer machines to help feed and fuel our communities, manage natural resources \nand connect people to life\u2019s necessities, we are committed to finding a better way to care for our \nenvironment, our people and our business around the world.\nJason Andringa\nPresident and CEO\n\nOUR ESG STORY\nSTARTS WITH HOW \nWE CARE FOR OUR\nEnvironment\nPeople\nBusiness\n\nVermeer designs and manufactures yellow iron that helps our customers do \nessential work we all depend on, while helping to manage the impact on our \nprecious natural resources and the environment we all need and enjoy for a life \nwell lived. The way we design, build and distribute our equipment is guided by a \ncollective mindset of continuous improvement while also reducing wasted time \nand materials. From our suppliers and our factories to our dealers and our \ncustomers, we work together, and improve together, in three important ways:\nImproving market methods |  Improving equipment design |  Improving manufacturing process \nA BETTER WAY                  \nTO CARE FOR OUR \nENVIRONMENT.\n\nIMPROVING MARKET METHODS\nA better way to make hay \nIn 1971, Vermeer introduced the world to the large, round hay baler to harvest and forage products on the farm in a much \nmore efficient and labor-saving way. What was once the job of many could now be done by one person. Since then, \nVermeer has led the way in hay and forage harvesting and processing innovations for more than five decades. And today, \nwe operate with the aspiration to help eliminate at least one machine pass in the field every five years with new equipment \ninnovation \u2013 ultimately reducing time worked and fuel used.\nA better way to manage our forests and organic waste \nIn the 1950s, Gary Vermeer and his team invented the first commercial stump cutter, paving the way for an entire lineup of \nequipment focused on sound tree care and organic waste processing. From stump cutters and brush chippers to large \ngrinders, trommel screens and compost turners, our environmental product line is continuously helping to improve our \nnatural environment. This includes beautifying green spaces, managing forestry undergrowth to help prevent wildfires, \nprocessing and composting wood waste so it can be converted to biomass, recycled and reused, and manage wooded \nareas around electrical lines to prevent damage or disruption.\nOur equipment is designed to do critical work in the markets we serve with the least amount of environmental disruption or disturbance. We have a long history of \nfinding a better way to innovate equipment to feed and fuel the world, manage our natural resources and install infrastructure that keeps people connected to the \nnecessities of life. With every product we commercialize, we work to improve the way work gets done to minimize the impact on the natural or human environment \nover previous Vermeer models or other equipment currently available in the market. Key examples include:\n\nA better way to install utilities \nUtility installation is critical to community development. Whether it\u2019s connecting high-speed fiber lines, water and sewer pipes, or \nmoving electric utilities underground to help prevent damage from natural disasters, Vermeer underground utility installation\nequipment is used. Today, our HDDs are used to help install these utilities in minimally invasive ways, and they are constantly \nbeing improved to help reduce noise and environmental emissions while doing their work. Our investments in a complete lineup \nof vacuum excavators are used to expose underground utilities to help improve the precision of underground utility work. And \nfinally, our company has a commitment to invest in technology that helps utility installation contractors better manage and \nreduce water use on jobsites.\nA better way to extract metals and minerals \nOur world depends on the mining industry to extract precious metals and minerals to be used in all kinds of technology and \ndevices, including Lithium batteries that are helping drive lower emissions.

Both the genesis of the pandemic crisis and the policies to contain the contagion, \nrather than promoting economic recovery, demonstrate how sustainability is an in-\ncreasingly central value, in Italy as well as abroad. This awareness, which has already \nbeen growing for several years, has intensified during the pandemic, to the point of \nbecoming a priority in the dialogue with investors, banking and financial institutions, \nlocal administrations, trade organizations, customers and suppliers.\nAt the end of 2019, a majority of Vetrerie Riunite\u2019s equity share was acquired by an \ninvestment fund of Sun Capital, a leading American Private Equity. This new sharehold-\ner structure has provided a further stimulus to share the sustainability policies already \nin place at the Group, as well as to strengthen and complete them, with a view to \ncontinuous improvement: the Vetrerie Riunite 2020 Sustainability Report therefore \ncaptures a snapshot during a path in full evolution: not a point of arrival, but rather a \nsolid platform, to reach new horizons of advancement.\nDespite the uncertainty caused at all levels by the pandemic, 2020 was a positive year \nfor Vetrerie Riunite: starting from the second half of the year, demand was at very high \nlevels from all customers, and it is maintained as such for the entire following year. At \nthe same time, a favorable product mix and some operating efficiencies made possible \nto close a year with a growth compared to the previous one.\nThe recent acquisition of the Group also coincided with a redefinition of its strategy, \nnow more clearly oriented towards consolidating its leadership in the sector of glass \nwashing machine doors, of which Vetrerie Riunite is already the first world producer, \nwith a global market share of approximately 40%. Following this strategic affirmation, \nthe Group proceeded, at the end of 2020, to the sale of the Vetri delle Venezie business \nunit, which - in addition to contributing negatively to the Group\u2019s results - represented \na risk of out-of-focus for management and production.\nGRI 102-14 Statement from senior decision-maker\n\n6\nFor 2021, the Group aims to consolidate the growth path started in the second half of \n2020, by investing in new production capacity - which allows it to capture new demand \ntrends - and in extraordinary transactions - which contribute to consolidating market \nleadership -. The washing machine market is constantly growing on all continents, and \nVetrerie Riunite is optimally positioned to benefit from this long-term trend, increasing \nits economies of scale and operational efficiencies.\nAlso, from the point of view of sustainability, Vetrerie Riunite intends to invest so that \n2021 represents a year of growth: various projects have been launched and are under-\nway, which aspire to consolidate the Group\u2019s positioning on the", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"102-18": {"matched_text": "Board of directors is mentioned in the report"}, "412-3": {"matched_text": "Human rights policy is mentioned"}, "405-1": {"matched_text": "Diversity is referenced in relation to governance or workforce"}}}}

We began as a manufacturer of transistor \ntest equipment 50 years ago and have transformed to become a global leader in storage technology, offering the \nworld\u2019s broadest portfolio of data storage solutions. Adaptation has been a consistent hallmark of our success.\nAs we move past a year that will undoubtedly be infamous for its challenges, we are encouraged by the worldwide \nadaptation to those struggles\u2014prompting changes that we hope will have lasting positive impacts. We remain \ncommitted to supporting the communities, environment and economies on which we all depend and doing our part \nto make sure the future is brighter for everyone. \n\nREPORTING AND MATERIALITY\nAs a reflection of the increasing importance of sustainability to our business, \nwe are adapting our annual sustainability reporting to align with our financial \nreporting. In conjunction with this change, we are publishing an ESG Data \nDownload with new sustainability data covering the second half of our fiscal \nyear 2020, supplementing the data covering the first fiscal half disclosed in \nour sustainability report published in August. The ESG Data Download also \nincludes recent fiscal year-based data that we previously reported for the \nequivalent calendar years. Going forward, we expect to publish our reports \nand the underlying data after the close of our fiscal year.\nIn this supplemental sustainability report, we share updates from fiscal year \n2020 on a few sustainability topics that are particularly significant to our \ncompany, as determined in our most recent materiality assessment. We \ncontinue to manage sustainability issues across the spectrum of materiality \nand look forward to providing a broader update in our next full report.\nENERGY AND EMISSIONS\nWe are doing more each year to reduce our climate impacts and \nimprove our climate resiliency. Even as our product shipments have \ngrown, a focus on data and efficiency has helped us achieve notable \nreductions in energy usage and emissions. This focus will only increase, \nas we are currently working to set long-term emissions reduction targets \nand implement TCFD recommendations.\n3.8%\t\nYear-over-year reduction in energy usage\nIN FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE ACHIEVED  \nTHE FOLLOWING MILESTONES:\n25%\t\t\nYear-over-year reduction in energy intensity\n5.2%\t\nYear-over-year reduction in Scope 1 emissions \nCO2e\n2\n6.3%\nYear-over-year reduction in Scope 2 emissions \nCO2e\n\nWASTE AND EFFICIENCY\nWestern Digital is always looking for opportunities \nto streamline our operations and reduce waste. \nWe piloted a new product take-back program on \nEarth Day 2020 called Easy Recycle, which offers \nincentives for consumers to return their products \nfor secure data destruction and recycling of the \nmaterials. In its short tenure so far, that program \nhas led to the recycling of 8,300 drives and the \navoidance of over four metric tons of waste.\nWe continued our focus on circularity in fiscal year \n2020 by completing our first set of ISO-conformant \nproduct lifecycle assessments. We are currently \nrunning additional assessments on other families of \nproducts and are using that data to further reduce \nthe impacts of our production.\nWater plays an important role in our manufacturing \nprocesses, and we made improvements in fiscal \nyear 2020 to significantly reduce our water use. At \nour Shanghai facility, we implemented several new \nreclamation projects to achieve a reclamation ratio \nof 95%, the highest in the region. Similar \nreclamation efforts in our Shenzhen facility earned \nrecognition from the local government and have \nresulted in conservation of 64 million gallons of \nwater annually.\nWe launched a new Easy \nRecycle product take-back \nprogram on Earth Day 2020. \nTo date, 8,300 drives have been \nrecycled and 4+ metric tons of \nwaste have been avoided.\nHuman rights and labor practices were high priorities \nfor us during fiscal year 2020. We published our first \nglobal human rights policy in May, which explains our \nexpectations for protecting human rights within our \nown operations as well as our supply chain. The high \nstandards set in that policy are based on \ninternational standards, the industry norms adopted \nby the Responsible Business Alliance and a careful \nanalysis of our business.\nTo continue our focus on human rights, we recently \nlaunched a human rights impact assessment, \nconsistent with the UN Guiding Principles on \nBusiness and Human Rights. In collaboration with an \nindependent firm with human rights expertise, we \nare evaluating potential human rights impacts of our \nbusiness and preparing to use that data to make \nfurther progress in our management of human rights.\nBroad-based diversity and inclusion are important \naspects of our business strategy, and we are proud \nthat as we entered fiscal year 2021, half of the \nmembers of our Board of Directors were women.
