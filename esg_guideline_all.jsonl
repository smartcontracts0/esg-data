In \nother words, decarbonization cannot happen through a shift in the allocation from sectors with high \npotential impact on climate change and its mitigation (e.g. energy, transport, manufacturing) to sectors with \ninherently limited impact (e.g. health care, media).

Coffee is one \nof the world\u2019s most traded commodities and \nconsumed beverages (Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations [FAO], \n2022b). The coffee plant is a shrub or small \ntree that needs about 3\u20134 years to start \nproducing red cherries, which are then \nstrip- or hand-harvested (National Coffee \nAssociation, n.d.). Strip harvesting, which \ncan be mechanized, involves removing all \nthe cherries from the branch at once, while \nhand harvesting, a more labour-intensive \nprocess, consists of selectively harvesting \nripened cherries. Harvested coffee cherries \nare processed immediately using a dry or wet \nmethod to facilitate the milling process, which \ninvolves hulling to extract the coffee bean \n(green coffee) and an optional polishing step \nbefore being graded and sorted by weight, \nsize, and quality so they can be sold (National \nCoffee Association, n.d.). Green coffee beans \nare then roasted to unlock their flavour, \nbecoming brown roasted beans, which are \nground and brewed to produce the coffee \nbeverage we commonly enjoy. \nArabica and Robusta are the two main \ncoffee species that have come to dominate \nthe market, with global production in 2020 \nconsisting of about 58% Arabica and 42% \nRobusta (International Coffee Organization, \n2021, p. 9). While many factors affect quality, \nArabica coffee has historically been considered \nhigher quality as it has a smoother, sweeter \ntaste.

In our important market of Germany, we even \nsucceeded in overtaking Bayer Consumer with our two companies \nSTADA and ALIUD to become number 1. \n \nThere are a variety of activities behind this pleasing development. Our \nrecipe for success is to focus continuously on Consumer Healthcare, \nGenerics and Specialty, and to realize synergies. However, our impres-\nsive growth course is primarily driven by our unique corporate culture, \nin which around 14,000 employees worldwide work together as  \nOne STADA to achieve a single overriding goal: \u201cCaring for People\u2019s \nHealth as a Trusted Partner\u201d. Especially in challenging times, it is par-\nticularly important to have this clarity about our purpose and values. \nThat is why I am very pleased with the results of our latest global \nemployee survey, conducted in May this year.\nOutstandingly, 88% of our colleagues took the time to participate in \nthe survey, which shows how engaged employees are across all func-\ntions and regions within the company.

Now, as the European\nBanking Authority has acknowledged that ESG risks can potentially impact the eco-\nnomic and financial system, the debate on systemic risk has gained traction. Under-\nstanding the relationship between ESG merit and systemic risk is of utmost\nimportance for the stability of the economic and financial system, still, research is lim-\nited. Relying on real-world European and United Stated data, we quantify systemic\nrisk by means of QL-CoVaR. Empirical analyses of the entire period from 2007 to\n2021 show that companies with high ESG scores tend to exhibit low QL-CoVaR\nvalues indicating a positive effect of ESG scores. Such evidence is confirmed by\nclustering the individual companies into ESG portfolios and focusing on COVID-19.\nAdditional insights using the individual pillars are also provided.\nK E Y W O R D S\nCoVaR, ESG, sustainability, financial stability, systemic risks\n1\n|\nINTRODUCTION\nCompany characteristics are the key driver in determining perfor-\nmance and risk profiles.

However, \nthis course of action - dealing with new requirements as they arise - has a major drawback. It \nlacks an overarching vision, neglecting the opportunities for value creation from adopting a \nmore holistic and long-term view.

While these developments are welcome \nresponses to the challenges of our times, they also mean \nthat companies are facing many choices when deciding \nwhat ESG information to report, how, to whom and where.  \nThe Corporate Reporting Dialogue (CRD) brings together \nsome of the most influential developers of ESG reporting \nframeworks and standards. The CRD is a response to \nmarket demand for greater coherence, consistency and \ncomparability between different frameworks.

Looking back on the \nacademic year, I could not be prouder of the accomplishments and contributions of our \nteam in advancing knowledge and practice in the realm of family business.  \n \nAround the world, 2021-22 offered some breathing room and a space to slowly regain a \nsense of balance and normalcy after two challenging years. As the year progressed, \nwe were happily offered greater opportunity for face-to-face interactions with students, \nalumni, scholars and family-business leaders.  \n \nThrough the distinct lens of family business, we leveraged our online communication \nplatforms to showcase the team\u2019s distinct areas of expertise: Pascual Berrone shed \nlight on strategy and sustainability, Alfonso Chiner examined governance and family \nvision, Heinrich Liechtenstein shared insights on family purpose and philanthropy, \nJeroen Neckebrouck explored entrepreneurship, investor strategy and diversity, and \nJosep T\u00e0pies shone a spotlight globalization, succession and ownership strategy.  \n \nFor my part, social responsibility, stakeholder relations and corporate governance were \nthe focus. Working together, we aimed to bring Aristotle\u2019s words to life by interweaving \nthese singular threads into a rich tapestry of knowledge on family business. \n \nAs we look ahead, we will continue to address the evolving challenges and hot-button \nissues f", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-11": {"matched_text": " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnnual Report \n2021-22 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAIR OF FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS \n\nAnnual Report 2021-22 \n \n \nAnnual Report \u00b7 2021-22 \n \n \n1 \n \n \n1. \nLETTER FROM THE HOLDER  \n2. \nTHE YEAR AT A GLANCE \n3. \nCHAIR OF FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS  \n4. \nHIGH-IMPACT RESEARCH \n5. \nPUBLICATIONS \n6. \nCOMMUNICATIONS  \n7. \nACADEMIC ACTIVITIES \n8. \nCONFERENCES & SEMINARS \n9. \nMEDIA COVERAGE  \n10. \nCONTACT US \n \n\nAnnual Report 2021-22 \n \n \nAnnual Report \u00b7 2021-22 \n \n \n2 \n \n \nLETTER FROM THE HOLDER  \n \nI", "confidence": 0.279}, "2-12": {"matched_text": " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnnual Report \n2021-22 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAIR OF FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS \n\nAnnual Report 2021-22 \n \n \nAnnual Report \u00b7 2021-22 \n \n \n1 \n \n \n1. \nLETTER FROM THE HOLDER  \n2. \nTHE YEAR AT A GLANCE \n3. \nCHAIR OF FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS  \n4. \nHIGH-IMPACT RESEARCH \n5. \nPUBLICATIONS \n6. \nCOMMUNICATIONS  \n7. \nACADEMIC ACTIVITIES \n8. \nCONFERENCES & SEMINARS \n9. \nMEDIA COVERAGE  \n10. \nCONTACT US \n \n\nAnnual Report 2021-22 \n \n \nAnnual Report \u00b7 2021-22 \n \n \n2 \n \n \nLETTER FROM THE HOLDER  \n \nI", "confidence": 0.27}, "2-21": {"matched_text": " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnnual Report \n2021-22 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCHAIR OF FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS \n\nAnnual Report 2021-22 \n \n \nAnnual Report \u00b7 2021-22 \n \n \n1 \n \n \n1. \nLETTER FROM THE HOLDER  \n2. \nTHE YEAR AT A GLANCE \n3. \nCHAIR OF FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS  \n4. \nHIGH-IMPACT RESEARCH \n5. \nPUBLICATIONS \n6. \nCOMMUNICATIONS  \n7. \nACADEMIC ACTIVITIES \n8. \nCONFERENCES & SEMINARS \n9. \nMEDIA COVERAGE  \n10. \nCONTACT US \n \n\nAnnual Report 2021-22 \n \n \nAnnual Report \u00b7 2021-22 \n \n \n2 \n \n \nLETTER FROM THE HOLDER  \n \nI", "confidence": 0.262}}}}

In our view, this is invariably due to the central bank's\naction of supplying an unlimited amount of liquidity. If we look at the valuations\u2019 of equities, we see that they are relatively higher than they were when the Nasdaq\nbubble burst in 2000 and the housing bubble burst in 2007. If you compare it to the previous quarter, stocks have also continued to appreciate relative to that\nquarter. At the end of March, the BF P/E was 22, also considered extremely high, but that number had risen to 23 by the end of July. What is noticeable, however, is\nthat investors are not so confident that at these levels stock market values are pegged at realistic prices. Amid a minor scare in the middle of the month, there were\nalmost no buyers and the indices fell more than 1.5% in 1 day. As we have pointed out many times before, this investment environment is solely due to the central\nbank's supply of unlimited liquidity. The problem will arise if inflation, contrary to the central bank's expectations, becomes permanent rather than temporary. The\nfinancial authorities will also have no choice but to raise interest rates, which in turn will hit equity investments very hard. Europe's economy has continued to\nimprove over the past month, and this is likely to have been helped by the fact that recovery aid set up during the epidemic has started to be distributed to the\nmember countries. The preliminary reading is that activity in the Eurozone's services sector showed a third month of growth, strengthening to 58 from 55.2 in May.\nAt the same time, manufacturing was also strong, with a reading of 63.1 reflecting 12 months of expansion. Of course, these macroeconomic numbers could quickly\nturn negative if the virus starts to spread again.

Through-\nout our history, the firm has always grown sustainably. Our growth can be \ndescribed as sustainable because it has been steady, continuous and always in \nthe interests of our clients.\nOur firm has consistently promoted a strong social and interpersonal collab-\norative environment, which is also reflected in our corporate culture. Twen-\nty-five years ago, the concept of environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nwas not attributed the same significance it has today. Now, ESG is an indispen-\nsable element of day-to-day business for companies and professional services \nfirms. Following new EU regulations, the capital market and many businesses \nare having to take a closer look at sustainability than ever before.\nLast year, we laid the foundation for our transparency regarding ESG by pub-\nlishing our first ever sustainability report for the year 2021. In doing so, we \nalso showed how motivated we are to contribute to the sustainable transfor-\nmation of the economy and society as a service provider. The overwhelmingly \npositive feedback we received for the report shows how important this issue \nhas become.\n \nWe see sustainability as an ongoing process that involves continuously devel-\noping measures and policies and thus successively integrating new aspects \nof ESG into the firm\u2019s b", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-3": {"matched_text": "SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nGSK Stockmann:  \nOur Milestones on  \nthe path  towards \ngreater sustainability\n\n02\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 | GSK STOCKMANN\nContents\nForeword \n03\nGSK Stockmann as a firm \n04\nWho we are \n05\n \nGSK Academy \n06\n \nCorporate culture and work environment \n08\n \nHealth promotion \n10\n \nTop employer \n11\n \nTop law firm \n12\nOur contribution to society \n13\n \nCivic engagement \n13\n \nSharing knowledge about ESG \n15\nEnvironmental and climate protection \n16\n \nSustainable procurement \n1", "confidence": 0.331}, "2-12": {"matched_text": "SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nGSK Stockmann:  \nOur Milestones on  \nthe path  towards \ngreater sustainability\n\n02\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 | GSK STOCKMANN\nContents\nForeword \n03\nGSK Stockmann as a firm \n04\nWho we are \n05\n \nGSK Academy \n06\n \nCorporate culture and work environment \n08\n \nHealth promotion \n10\n \nTop employer \n11\n \nTop law firm \n12\nOur contribution to society \n13\n \nCivic engagement \n13\n \nSharing knowledge about ESG \n15\nEnvironmental and climate protection \n16\n \nSustainable procurement \n1", "confidence": 0.309}, "413-2": {"matched_text": "SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\nGSK Stockmann:  \nOur Milestones on  \nthe path  towards \ngreater sustainability\n\n02\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022 | GSK STOCKMANN\nContents\nForeword \n03\nGSK Stockmann as a firm \n04\nWho we are \n05\n \nGSK Academy \n06\n \nCorporate culture and work environment \n08\n \nHealth promotion \n10\n \nTop employer \n11\n \nTop law firm \n12\nOur contribution to society \n13\n \nCivic engagement \n13\n \nSharing knowledge about ESG \n15\nEnvironmental and climate protection \n16\n \nSustainable procurement \n1", "confidence": 0.278}}}}

We have had challenges with constant price increases, \nthe introduction of the UTP directive, increased interest costs, extraordinary shipping costs, disruptions in the value chain and raw \nmaterial shortages, which are critical factors and areas for a product company like Humble. Despite the challenges, we have \nmanaged to maintain strong underlying growth, where we increased pro forma turnover by a whopping 22 percent and at the same \ntime defended our profitability. It is in times that these opportunities arise. I dare say that we are better equipped than ever to \ncontinue on the beaten path of building the leading modern FMCG group.\nDuring the year, we have developed and changed the Group in many ways. We have recently changed accounting principles to IFRS\nand launched the new business segments Future Snacking, Quality Nutrition, Sustainable Care and Nordic Distribution. Overall, the \nnew segments mean a clearer operational focus on the respective core business and show how we position our subsidiaries to jointly \ntake market shares and compete in the traditional trade.

The first that comes to\nmy mind is the Bruntland report in 1987, stating that sustainable development is\ndevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the\nability of future generations to meet their own needs.\nThis was followed by the Earth Summit in 1992 which produced the Rio Declaration on\nEnvironment and Development, the Statement of Forest Principles, and Agenda 21.\nThe Earth Summit also led to the establishment of the Convention on Biological\nDiversity, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC). Furthermore, the three main pillars of sustainable development were\ndefined as economic growth, environmental protection, and social equality, where\nno one element is more important than the other. If one element dominates the others,\nor one element is neglected, the system becomes instable and collapses.\nThirty years later, the language has become more sophisticated, and at the\nSustainable Development Summit in 2015 we witnessed the introduction of the\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a collection of 17 interlinked global\ngoals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future\nfor all. This was a major step for a broader communication, and even down to\nkindergartens, the message was heard.Message from IWC\u2019s CEO", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-12": {"matched_text": "\nPage 2\nESG\nis\nbecoming\na\nmainstream\ncomponent\nof\nreporting,\nhereby\nincreasing\ntransparency on a variety of elements considered key metrics as to the sustainability of\na company or investments.\nHistorically, the industrialized and globalized societies have focused on the state of the\neconomy, while the language and culture around sustainability have had limited\nattention.

Together with our RBC Strategy colleague Sara\nMahaffy, we explore recent ESG investment trends, and provide detail of our coverage\nuniverse's sustainability efforts and goals across key restaurant-specific ESG categories, as\nidentified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\nThe growing importance of sustainable investing: By our estimate, we\u2019ve identified $476 billion in\ndedicated sustainable equity funds (with meaningful assets invested in the US), up from just $182 billion\nat the end of 2018. Net inflows into these funds have accelerated in recent years, with 4Q inflows on\npace to hit another new record.

As what \ndrives this disagreement is unclear, we examine whether a firm\u2019s ESG disclosure helps explain \nsome of this disagreement. We predict and find that greater ESG disclosure actually leads to \ngreater ESG rating disagreement. These findings hold using firm fixed effects, and using a \ndifference-in-differences design with mandatory ESG disclosure shocks. We also find that raters \ndisagree more about ESG outcome metrics than input metrics (policies), and that disclosure \nappears to amplify disagreement more for outcomes. Lastly, we examine consequences of ESG \ndisagreement and find that greater ESG disagreement is associated with higher return volatility, \nlarger absolute price movements, and a lower likelihood of issuing external financing. Overall, our \nfindings highlight that ESG disclosure generally exacerbates ESG rating disagreement rather than \nresolving it. \n \n \nKeywords: ESG Ratings; Rating Agency Disagreement; ESG Disclosure; Corporate Social \nResponsibility; Sustainability \nJEL Classification: G24, M14, M41, Q56 \nThe data used in this study are publicly available from the sources cited in the text \n________________________________________________________________________ \nWe thank Vishal Baloria, Mark Bradshaw, Mary Ellen Carter, Jeff Doyle, Jacquelyn Gillette, Michelle Hanlon, Amy \nHutton, Zach Kaplan, Kevin Koharki, Brad Lindsey, Christopher Noe, Kyle Peterson, Sugata Roychowdhury, Susan \nShu, Chad Simon, Chris Skousen, Eric So, Rodrigo Verdi, Joe Weber, and workshop part", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-12": {"matched_text": " \n \n \nWhy is Corporate Virtue in the Eye of The Beholder?

In \nthe Supervisory Board, we looked at the importance of ESG for Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group as a whole, the \nbusiness opportunities it presents and the progress made in each respective area.

I also feel \ngood about the resources we have dedicated to \nsustainability \u2013 a crucial part of an ambitious \napproach to sustainability. Not only do we have a \nteam within the investment team that takes \nleadership on sustainability issues, but we also have \nextensive resources to draw on through our close \ncollaboration with the rest of SEB and can access \ndeep ESG expertise to the benefit of our investors \nand portfolio companies.\nI\u2019m also happy with the impressive work of our \nportfolio companies. In 2022, we had our first \nportfolio company, Accedo, submit a Science-Based \nTarget. Accedo has taken a very proactive \napproach to sustainability and aims to be a leader in \nsustainability in the media-tech industry, as they see \nthe benefits it has on recruiting and employee \nretention, customer dialogues, and reputation \namong ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-3": {"matched_text": "Sustainability Report 2022\nSEB Private Equity\n1\n\nSEB Private Equity Sustainability report 2022\nTable of contents\n1.

This evaluation is based on publicly available information released by the companies through their \nwebsites, exchange filings, annual reports, investor presentations, sustainability reports, etc. It also factors in other \nmaterial ESG information available in the public domain through reliable sources, such as data reported by industry \nassociations, regulators and various government agencies.

It is based on the research and recommendations of the \nreport ESG Data in China: Recommendations on Primary ESG indicators. This research showed that \nwhile there was broad alignment between international and Chinese corporate environmental, social \nand governance (ESG) data disclosure practices, the disclosures being provided by Chinese companies \nare not standardised and not readily comparable across markets, industries and portfolios. The report \ncommented that this lack of comparability limits investors\u2019 ability to integrate ESG data into their \ninvestment decisions, and acts as a barrier to increased investment in green and sustainable assets.  \nThe report therefore recommended that Chinese financial regulators introduce a mandatory \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure framework, requiring all major companies to \nreport on a series of standard ESG indicators and to supplement these quantitative metrics with \nrelated information on governance, strategy and risk management. \nIn addition to this report, PRI was asked by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to \nprovide guidance on the specific regulations or regulatory clauses that would be required to \nimplement ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-12": {"matched_text": " \n \n \nKEY CONSIDERATIONS ON ESG DISCLOSURE POLICY \nDESIGN FOR CHINA \nINTRODUCTION \nThe United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is the world\u2019s leading \ninitiative on responsible investment.

We are confident that the strong interest to this call for evidence has enabled us to \ndraw some conclusions that will prove useful for the European Commission\u2019s deliberations4. \nWhile our main line of enquiry has been to establish the number of ESG rating providers active \nin the EU, we are also pleased to provide ancillary information on the characteristics of these \nprovider and their business models that may be of relevance for your staff\u2019s considerations. \nBased on our initial analysis, these conclusions generally confirm the concerns raised in \nESMA\u2019s letter to Commissioner Mairead McGuinness in January 20215.  \nOur input is structured to first provide a short introduction to the broader context in which this \ncall for evidence was launched, and the key objectives that have guided its development. After \nthis, we provide the key findings, both overall, and for the different categories of respondents. \nFinally, we close by outlining our view on the nature and scale of this market in the EU.  \n \n                     ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-12": {"matched_text": " \nThe Chair \n \n \n \n \nESMA \u2022 201-203 rue de Bercy \u2022 CS 80910 \u2022 75589 Paris Cedex 12 \u2022 France \u2022 Tel. +33 (0) 1 58 36 43 21 \u2022 www.esma.europa.eu \nMr John Berrigan \nDirector General \nDirectorate General for Financial \nStability, Financial Services and \nCapital Markets Union  \nEuropean Commission \nRue de la Loi I/Wetstraat 200 \n1049 Brussels, Belgium \n \nRef: Outcome of ESMA Call for Evidence on Market Characteristics of ESG \nRating and Data Providers in the EU \nDear Mr Berrigan, dear Sean, \nI am plea", "confidence": 0.361}, "207-4": {"matched_text": " \nThe Chair \n \n \n \n \nESMA \u2022 201-203 rue de Bercy \u2022 CS 80910 \u2022 75589 Paris Cedex 12 \u2022 France \u2022 Tel. +33 (0) 1 58 36 43 21 \u2022 www.esma.europa.eu \nMr John Berrigan \nDirector General \nDirectorate General for Financial \nStability, Financial Services and \nCapital Markets Union  \nEuropean Commission \nRue de la Loi I/Wetstraat 200 \n1049 Brussels, Belgium \n \nRef: Outcome of ESMA Call for Evidence on Market Characteristics of ESG \nRating and Data Providers in the EU \nDear Mr Berrigan, dear Sean, \nI am plea", "confidence": 0.339}, "204-1": {"matched_text": " \nThe Chair \n \n \n \n \nESMA \u2022 201-203 rue de Bercy \u2022 CS 80910 \u2022 75589 Paris Cedex 12 \u2022 France \u2022 Tel. +33 (0) 1 58 36 43 21 \u2022 www.esma.europa.eu \nMr John Berrigan \nDirector General \nDirectorate General for Financial \nStability, Financial Services and \nCapital Markets Union  \nEuropean Commission \nRue de la Loi I/Wetstraat 200 \n1049 Brussels, Belgium \n \nRef: Outcome of ESMA Call for Evidence on Market Characteristics of ESG \nRating and Data Providers in the EU \nDear Mr Berrigan, dear Sean, \nI am plea", "confidence": 0.335}}}}

To put the national income-based system in context, it is related below\nto, inter alia, information on occupational and private pensions. However, data for\nthese insurance systems are so far only available up to and including 2019, thus the\namounts below refer to 2019. Private pension refers only to data on tax-deductible\npension savings.\nTotal annual fees and premiums for national pension, occupational pensions, and\nprivate pensions are estimated at SEK\u00a0549\u00a0billion, of which the national pension\u2019s\nSEK\u00a0334\u00a0billion represents 61\u00a0percent. The wage bill in Sweden amounted to\napproximately SEK\u00a01,940\u00a0billion in 2019 (including earnings of the self-employed).\nThis means that we set aside an amount equal to 28\u00a0percent of our salaries for\nvarious pensions.\nFunded capital in the national pension amounted to SEK\u00a03,152\u00a0billion on December\n31 2019. This corresponds to approximately 46\u00a0percent of total funded pension\ncapital in Sweden at one time. The Swedish Pensions Agency paid out\nSEK\u00a0326\u00a0billion in inkomstpension and premium pension in 2019. It equates to\n67\u00a0percent of the total amount paid out that same year.\nThe Orange Report thus accounts for significantly more than half of Sweden\u2019s\npension activities involving contributions and disbursements. The fact that it reflects a\nlower proportion of funded capital is due to the fact that inkomstpension is a\ndistribution system with a buffer fund and not a fully funded pension system.\nIn 2019, in addition to inkomstpension and premium pension, the Swedish Pensions\nAgency paid out guaranteed pension to the amount of SEK\u00a013\u00a0billion. Other pension-\nrelated benefits paid by the Agency during the year to elderly persons include\nincome-based widow\u2019s pension of SEK\u00a010\u00a0billion, ", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"201-3": {"matched_text": "ORANGE REPORT 2020  \nAnnual Report of the Swedish Pension System \n\nOrange Report 2020\nThe Orange Report 2020 describes the financial position of the national income-\nbased pension system at the end of 2020, its evolution in 2020, and three scenarios\nfor the future.

In \n2021, 62% of the paper packaging material we sold \nwas FSC\u00ae-certified, up from only 3% in 2020.   \n\t\u203a 75% RECYCLED CONTENT (PIW & PCW) BY \n2030. In 2021, 60% of the pulp used to manufacture \nour paper supply was recycled content, up from \n55% in 2020.  \n\t\u203a 25% POST-CONSUMER WASTE (PCW) BY 2030.  \nIn 2021, we surpassed this target, with 38% of the \npulp used to manufacture our paper supply being \nPCW, up from 17% in 2020.  \n\t\u203a 46% REDUCTION IN GHG EMISSIONS BY \n2030. In 2021, our combined scope 1 and scope \n2 greenhouse gas emissions increased by \napproximately 12% from 2020, but decreased by 2% \nfrom 2019, the last year unaffected by COVID.    \nAs these results show, we made tremendous \nprogress on our FSC\u00ae-Certification and Recycled \nContent targets \u2013 and surpassed our Post-\nConsumer Waste target.  Substantially all of our \nPCW gains reflect our paper suppliers\u2019 increased \nuse of PCW as an ingredient in the paper we \nsource, a trend we hope will continue in 2022.  \nNevertheless, our engineering and product \nmanagement teams will continue to work hard \nto qualify additional papers", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-12": {"matched_text": "2021 ESG  \nImpact Report\n\nA Word from Our Chairman & CEO\nAt Ranpak, 2021 was a year of \ninvestment.

This paper addresses \nthe challenges linked to responsible sourcing and describes how Volvo Cars works to manage related \nrisks within our global supply chains. Furthermore, this paper outlines our aim to ensure that the \nmaterials used in our products are sourced responsibly and do not contribute to armed conflict, human \nrights abuses, or environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. \nBackground and challenge \nThe acceleration of electric vehicle (EV) production is crucial for the transition to a low-carbon \neconomy. However, a typical electric car requires more critical material inputs (meaning materials with \nhigh economic importance and high supply risk) compared to a conventional car. Material extraction, \nprocessing, trade, and transportation may cause or contribute to adverse impacts for people and \nplanet, for example child or forced labour, money laundering, pollution, and deforestation. Risks are \nespecially prevalent for materials from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). Hence, risk-\nbased supply chain due diligence is necessary to enable responsible sourcing1. \nVolvo Cars position \nVolvo Cars aim to protect and improve people\u2019s lives in our value ch", "output": {"matched_disclosures": {"2-28": {"matched_text": " \n1.

SG has been \nstrengthening its climate commitments, including in renewable energy financing and \naims to align its financing portfolios to a 1.5-degree Celsius pathway by 2050. Its \naction plan includes phasing out coal, excluding hydrocarbons such as shale oil and \noil sands, and reducing exposure to the most material carbon-intensive sectors. \nWhile implementation of the ESG integration framework is not yet systematic, the \nbank is actively strengthening its process for a comprehensive coverage of all large \ncorporates. On that, we view favorably the ESG-by-design project to develop \nprocesses and tools to monitor SG\u2019s sustainability engagements. We highlight the \nbank's strong performance on customer engagement, capitalizing on the digitization \ntrend with Boursorama.

This would \ninclude disclosure of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.2 \nThe SEC proposed rules are built into the disclosure \nframework of the Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) and the GHG Protocol.\nIn April 2022, the Executive (EX) Committee of the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) \napproved revisions to the annual Climate Risk Disclosure \nSurvey to better align with the TCFD disclosure framework \nand the GHG Protocol.3\nWhile the comment period has closed, the SEC received \nalmost 15,000 comments related to the proposed rules. \nWith this high response rate, the discussion of the \nrules is prevalent throughout the industry.
