{"task": "Quantitative ESG data extraction", "input": "2019 Engagement Report \n \n \nEngaging with issuers on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues is a vital part of AB\u2019s \nfundamental research. Our analysts collaborate with responsible investment experts to better \nunderstand the impact of ESG considerations on company performance and\u2014increasingly\u2014to advocate \nfor advancements in behavior and business practices. \nOur analysts and portfolio managers share insights using proprietary research and collaboration tools. \nPRISM, a fixed-income credit rating and scoring system, includes ESG scores assigned to each issuer by \nAB analysts that are accessible to investment professionals in real time. Equity analysts use ESIGHT, a \nproprietary ESG research collaboration platform where AB analysts input their ESG assessments and \nresults from company engagements, and house third-party research. Analysts also exchange \nperspectives across asset classes to gain a more complete picture of investments. \nESG considerations have long been integrated in our investment process, because they\u2019re critical to \nmaking informed risk/return assessments and investment conclusions. The methods of applying ESG \nconsiderations vary. Some teams directly incorporate ESG concerns into their discount rate; others \ninclude ESG insights in the information mosaic that shapes investment decisions.  \nIn 2019, AB\u2019s analysts\u2014often collaborating with our responsible investing specialists\u2014conducted 328 \nESG-focused engagements with issuers. It was a global effort, addressing issues across the ESG \nspectrum: 45% of engagements were on governance, 35% on social issues and 20% on environmental.  \nOften, these engagements cover multiple topics. We expect engagement on social and environmental \nissues to increase over time.  \n \nThe engagement examples in the following pages are intended to be a representative sample of our \nengagements on environmental, social and governance issues with firms in diverse industries and \n\ngeographies. Collectively, we believe they provide perspective on how we\u2019re engaging companies on \nESG issues.  \nEnvironmental Engagement \n \nReckitt Benckiser (Household Products)  \nWe had multiple engagements with this UK-based multinational consumer goods company in 2019 on \nthe management of its product carbon footprint, climate change risks, greenhouse gas emissions and \nsocial impact on communities. These issues provide Reckitt Benckiser with opportunities to improve \noperational performance and enhance its position with consumers who are increasingly supporting \nbrands with strong environmental focus on sustainable production and packaging. \nThe company had set several ambitious environmental goals for 2020 including a 40% reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions stemming from manufacturing, a 35% reduction in energy consumption and a \n33% reduction in carbon footprint. At the time of our engagement with Reckitt Benckiser in May 2019, \nthe company had reduced emissions by 35.2% and energy consumption by 22.6%, but its carbon \nfootprint was only 4% smaller. The company had also targeted a transition to 100% renewable energy by \n2030, which is ambitious given that the renewable sourcing for manufacturing sites was 30%. \n \nReckitt Benckiser uses carbon lifecycle modeling to understand and manage its climate change risks and \nimpacts throughout the value chain. To improve its environmental profile and achieve its goals, the \ncompany is implementing energy-efficient production processes, investing in purchased and on-site \nrenewable energy, and advancing its sustainable innovation program.  \n \nDespite these efforts, our ongoing engagement with Reckitt Benckiser revealed that the company is not \nadequately focused on executing its environmental strategy, as observed in the underperformance \ntowards its own stated 2020 environmental targets. During meetings with company management in the \nthird quarter, we re-iterated our view that effectively managing emissions and energy consumption was \ncritical to improving operational performance. However, we ultimately concluded that Reckitt Benckiser \nwas not fully executing its high-profile environmental initiatives \u2013 presenting a potential long-term risk \nto the company\u2019s brand and reputation with consumers.  \n \nAlthough we are continuing to monitor the company\u2019s progress in these areas and plan to continue our \nengagements in 2020, we have lowered our price target due to the lack of tangible focus on the \nenvironmental risks identified and discussed.     \n \nSuzano (Paper Products)  \nBrazil-based Suzano is one of the largest paper and eucalyptus pulp producers in the world, with \nbusinesses including forestry, cellulose, paper, biotechnology, Eucafluff, tissue and lignin.

For all of us, setting \nambitious goals has been an \nincredible source of acceleration. And \ntherefore performance. This ambition \nrequires us to be bolder, more creative \nand more innovative on a daily basis. \nAs of now, I can say that we will be \nable to meet the majority of the \nprogramme\u2019s 2020 goals.

We have \ninitiated the development of a global \nstandard for apprentices, with the aim of \nproviding young technicians with oppor\u00ad\ntunities to gain hands-on experience \nunder direct tutoring of seasoned Schindler \nprofessionals, scaling up the state-of-the-\nart programs that have been established \nfor decades in Switzerland and Germany. \nMany graduates will join our next ge-\nneration of employees, while others will \ngo on with their careers armed with a \n\u201cSchindler degree.\u201d\nFostering an inclusive work environment, \nbringing together people with different \nbackgrounds, valuing different perspectives \nand embracing an open dialogue are other \nkey elements for future success. We have \nmade strides towards a more diverse work-\nforce and are committed to continuing \nthis journey, by broadening the scope of \nour initiatives well beyond gender balance. \nWe continue to meet the evolving ex-\npectation of building owners, developers, \nand architects to construct and refurbish \nin line with green certifications schemes. \nIn 2019, we completed the refurbishment \nof our own headquarters in Ebikon (built \n60 years ago), which was awarded with a \nGold LEED Certification, the standard for \ngreen buildings. \nInevitably, we also strive for improvements \nin areas where we have not been as suc\u00ad\ncessful as we would have liked, such as \nreducing the carbon footprint of our global \nvehicle fleet. Our Group is resolved to find \nnew ways to support our service techni\u00ad\ncians, reducing both their time on the road \nand the polluting emissions associated \nwith it.\nAs a closely held company, Schindler is \ndedicated to healthy growth. Step by \nstep, year after year, we continue to build \non the foundation of sustainability laid \nover five generations, for the future of \nour customers, our employ\u00adees, our share\u00ad\nholders, our communities, and our planet.\n\n\n\n\nSilvio Napoli\nChairman of the Board of Directors\nMessage from \nthe Chairman\nAs I write this message, the world is still in \nthe midst of battling a global pandemic. \nThe COVID-19 outbreak is a deep humani\u00ad\ntarian crisis that has gravely affected the \nworld and the economy.

It also exposed and\nexacerbated broader trends in society, bringing to light our role in confronting inequalities associated with systemic \nracism and historical disadvantages that people of color face.\nAfter we parked aircraft, adjusted policies and procedures, and ensured a healthy and safe operation, we quickly \nshifted our focus to rebounding stronger and seizing new opportunities made available from the pandemic to better \nposition JetBlue once travel returned. How could we apply lessons learned in responding to the pandemic to the \nmitigation of future risks?\nUltimately for us, our experiences in 2020 only reinforced the importance of mitigating risks that threaten the \nhealth of our business. Although at times challenging, we have only sharpened our focus on all things ESG \u2013 \nincluding identifying, tracking, and responding to the wide variety of threats our business may face in the future.\nAs such, 2020 was not just the year of COVID-19 \u2013 it was also the year that we became the first U.S. airline to \nachieve domestic carbon neutrality, realized today through large-scale carbon offsetting. It was also the year we \nbegan flying regularly on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from San Francisco International Airport \u2013 allowing us to \nreduce lifecycle emissions up to 80% per gallon of delivered neat fuel.\n2020 was also the year we launched our Diversity Leadership Council and a reimagined company-wide focus on \nconfronting and correcting potential biases and inequalities in our communities and workplace. It was also the \nyear we stood up our ESG Subcommittee of our Board of Directors, allowing for more focused discussion and \nadvancement of key ESG issues at the highest level of company leadership.\nAs we move forward, we see substantial business opportunity associated with the climate transition and movement \ntoward a more just, diverse and inclusive business. We are inspired by our crewmembers\u2019 and industry\u2019s resiliency \nand the unparalleled focus and commitment from other corporations, governments, and individuals to work \ntogether and do better.

The pandemic caused a perfect storm that affected the ganglia \nof our economy and our daily lives. Fortunately, despite its atavistic criticalities, the country\u2019s system reacted, \nraising its head - as always - in times of great difficulty, with the aim of rebuilding a new normality.\nWe did the same as a company, by reflexively involving all those who are directly and indirectly responsible for \nthe operation of our business. I refer first of all to our customers around the world: our greatest effort has been \nto create and standardise new procedures for the testing and delivery of our technologies. Then I am talking \nabout our suppliers, an operational microcosm made up of small and very small production companies whose \nwork is essential for the proper functioning of the Group.\nThe integrity of the socio-economic fabric of the entire country depends on the nourishment and development \nof this fragmented yet strategic supply chain: that is why we have inaugurated an innovative Master\u2019s degree \nprogramme dedicated exclusively to our sub-supply chain.\nI was talking about reconstruction. In 2021, with this in mind, we decided to focus even more on the values of \nidentity and solidarity by setting up the Marchesini ACT Foundation, an acronym that stands for the concepts of \nAvant-garde, Culture and Territory. Avant-garde understood as innovation, curiosity, a drive towards the new, \nand a love for research; Culture signifies not only knowledge and technical culture, but also inclusion through \nknowledge, diversity as a value and mutual enrichment; and, finally, Territory, with a focus on the enhancement \nof people as well as local and national traditions.\nIf the Foundation can be understood as our eye to the outside world, corporate welfare - to which part of the \nnew Sustainability Report is dedicated \u2013 represents an increasingly intense and multifaceted focus on our \nemployees, to whom my gratitude and greetings go. All of them, in different ways and forms, have contributed \nto the achievement of the company\u2019s results, partly also thanks to their willingness to vaccinate themselves at \nan early stage and to follow the recommendations and advice aimed at leading our large family into the future.\nA future that - I am sure - will be bright for all those who share dreams and work together, step by step, to build \nits foundations. \nMaurizio Marchesini\nPRESIDENT\n\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n5\nIt has been a turbulent year. We have had to deal with the consequences of a pandemic of unthinkable scale, which \nwas followed by a similarly unimaginable military conflict - as early as November 2021, international observers had \nreported Russian troops massed on the Ukrainian borders. \nAs an osmotic creature by definition, the company is affected by everything that happens around it. That is why - in a \ncontext that has shaken seemingly solid businesses and brought unprecedented circumstances to the fore - we are \nall the more proud of having preserved and even improved our objectives.\nTo achieve this, we relied on our all-Italian ability to successfully deal with the most critical exogenous variables, \ndrawing heavily on our \u201cknow how\u201d - which is almost 50 years old but not so set in stone that it cannot mutate. It has \nrequired, more than ever in these hectic times, a constant and determined spirit of adaptation. We would never have \nimagined testing drug packaging machines remotely \u2013 but this is exactly what we did. We would never have thought \nit possible to build a vaccine packaging line in just six months \u2013 and yet we did so! It was not in our plans to schedule \nmore flexible working hours for our employees \u2013 but our plans changed. The face of the world is changing, with \nlittle or no notice; if companies wish to not only survive but also continue to grow, they must reshape their historical \nparadigms to suit the present. This is called resilience: an abused term, which nevertheless perfectly expresses the \nmantra that inspires the new normal in our business. \nAnd our packaging machine business remains strong: in 2021 the sector\u2019s turnover stood at EUR 8.5 billion, up 8% \non the previous year. These are impressive figures, but we must not rest on our laurels. New social sensitivities are \ncalling for more research and development on sustainable materials, which is why we have invested in Rinova - our \nbrand of second li", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Employees hold a\nprivileged position within the value chain. Training and\nskills development are therefore essential resources for\nM6, which also relies on the expertise of teams and the\nintellectual property of formats and brands, as well and an\nextensive catalogue of audiovisual rights.\n- Financial and industrial resources, which are the capital\ninvested by shareholders as well as the profits generated\nover the years and reinvested in the development of M6\nGroup. M6 Group also uses buildings, studios, warehouses,\nfacilities, etc. to create value.\n- Corporate, social and environmental resources, which are\nsimultaneously the natural resources utilised (electricity,\npaper, etc.) as well as M6 Group\u2019s commitments to\nsociety, the relationships between the Group\u2019s brands,\nviewers, listeners, etc.\n\u25cfFor each of the Group\u2019s business cycles (which are grouped\ninto 4 segments of financial information), there are\ncorresponding values created by M6 (audiovisual content,\nchannels, etc.) that form the basis of financial and non-\nfinancial performance.\n7.1.1.2 CSR CHALLENGES \nFaced with various corporate, social and environmental \nchallenges, M6 Group has been pursuing an active CSR policy for \nmany years and clearly states its commitments to all its \npartners: it has developed a CSR policy structured around four \npriorities, directly related to its activities: \n\u25cfRespect for the public and responsibility towards society:\nsince the Group\u2019s activity is primarily intangible and cultural,\nthe societal impact is the unifying thread of its commitment.\nThrough its programmes, the Group actually enters into\npeoples\u2019 homes and therefore respect for viewers must be at\nthe heart of what it does.\n\u25cfTalent management: the Group firmly believes that its\nemployees are the cornerstone of its success. It is for this\nreason that the Human Resources Department places\nemployee selection and subsequent loyalty building at the\nheart of its concerns, and endeavours to promote employee\ndevelopment in all aspects of their professional life.\n\u25cfNon-discrimination: taking diversity into account is a key\nconcern for the Group, both in relation to audiovisual\ncontent and the audience it addresses. This is reflected\nnotably by a cross-organisational and acknowledged\ncommit", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

The results will be disclosed as part of Cisco\u2019s fiscal 2022 ESG reporting. \nTCFD was established to assess potential business impacts of climate change, including efforts to reduce GHG \nemissions and to mitigate the impact of climate change. These impacts can potentially emerge over a time period \nmeasured in decades and for which typical business forecasting is not well suited. Suggested TCFD methodology \nfocuses on evaluating scenarios. Per section B.2 of TCFD Technical Supplement, The Use of Scenario Analysis in \nDisclosure of Climate Related Risks and Opportunities: \nIt is important to remember that scenarios are hypothetical constructs; they are not forecasts or predictions \nnor are they sensitivity analyses\u2026 Scenario analysis is a tool to enhance critical strategic thinking. A key \nfeature of scenarios is that they should challenge conventional wisdom about the future.\nSection B.2 of the Technical Supplement further explains that scenarios should be plausible, distinctive, \nconsistent, relevant and challenging. \nThe science and scenarios \nThe impact of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is projected to have increasing \nimpacts on climate as the global average temperature increases due to the retention of energy previously \nradiated into space. The Data shown in the chart Atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory gives a clear \nview of the potential for climate change given the unabated increases in CO2 concentrations that interfere with \nblack body re-radiation. The Mauna Loa data only reports on CO2. Other GHG emissions, such as methane and \nchlorofluorocarbons, are also increasing, contributing to the absorption of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth. \nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to increase and are increasing at a faster rate (see figure on/showing \nAtmospheric CO2 concentrations at Mauna Loa Observatory)\nBefore 1960, the rate of increase was less than 1 ppm CO2 /yr. Today the increase is more than 2.5 ppm/yr, with \nthe absolute CO2 concentration increasing from around 315 ppm CO2 to about 415 ppm CO2. Extrapolating to \nthe year 2050, CO2 concentrations will likely approach or even exceed 500 ppm CO2. This path to 500 ppm by \n2050 has been chosen as our base-case scenario. This base case includes GHG reduction efforts implemented \nworldwide to date and that may continue, but which have not had an appreciable impact on GHG concentrations \nin the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nFrom the IPCC report, Climate Change 2014 \u2013 Synthesis Report (see figure on or showing Atmospheric CO2 \nconcentrations for the past 800,000 years), the increase in CO2 concentration above the historic maximum of 280 \nppm has gone from 35 ppm CO2 in 1960 to 135 ppm CO2 in 2020 (280+35=315 ppm, the approximate CO2 \nconcentration in 1960; 280+135=415 ppm, the approximate CO2 concentration in 2020). \nPer the IPCC report, Climate Change 2014 \u2013 Synthesis Report (Table 3.1, p. 22), 500 ppm in 2050 is indicative of a \n3\u00b0 C temperature rise \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d Continued increases in GHG concentration through 2100 would further \npush temperature upward. Cisco is using the \u201c2050 base case\u201d for its scenario construction and risk assessment.\nA second scenario is constructed projecting that, as of some future date, there will be no net impact on GHG \nconcentrations from Cisco operations or from its products.

In partic-\nular, various elements causing instability, such as reduced automobile produc-\ntion due to semiconductor shortage, rapid rise in ocean freight as a result of the \nglobal logistics disruption, increased prices of raw materials, and anti-dumping \ntariff imposition by the US, wielded a negative impact on the tire industry. It also \naffected NEXEN TIRE. Despite record-high sales of KRW 2.0794 trillion, our oper-\nating profit was only KRW 4.4 billion due to the impact of the internal and exter-\nnal environment. However, we established a basis for securing a future growth \nengine by producing remarkable performances, which include expansion of sup-\nply to premium automotive companies such as Porsche and Audi, designation as \nthe best supplier by Stellantis, awarding Podium prize in Toyota 86/BRZ Race, and \nreceipt of the Grand Prize in the Korea Labor-Management Cooperation Awards.\nThis year, although the unstable management environment persists, we will \nmove forward to grow into a sustainable company by actively responding to the \nchallenges and tasks we face. To this end, we will implement the following strat-\negies. In order to minimize the impact of instability in the global supply chain, \nNEXEN TIRE will establish mid- to long-term response strategies for shipping \ncompanies and increase the percentage of overseas sales by securing local dis-\ntribution bases. We will also strengthen core competencies by business sector in \norder to realize customer delight, establish a multi-plant production system, and \nsecure quality competitiveness in", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

The tragic events unfolding in \nUkraine have had an unimaginable human toll but also serve to remind us of the complexity and \nsecurity of the global energy supply network. We are proud of the role Precision Drilling plays as a \nclean, socially responsible, and ethically governed participant in the upstream energy supply chain. \nThe key elements of \u201cESG,\u201d environmental impact and climate change, social impact, and ethical \ngovernance, are foundational to Precision\u2019s business strategy as our competitive advantage is \nbased on our ability to provide highly skilled, safety-focused, and disciplined crews on our High-\nPerformance drilling rigs.\nIn 2019, we completed our first companywide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions baseline \nassessment and have continued this practice for 2020 and 2021. In 2022, we will use the results \nfrom these assessments to develop our long-term plan to achieve net zero. We believe a net zero \ntarget for our business is achievable, but the timeline is uncertain as some of the technology and \nenergy infrastructure required are well beyond our scope of influence.\nOur rigs are designed to drill efficiently, which requires less energy, produces lower GHG emissions, \nand reduces environmental impact. Precision has a long history of developing technologies \nand systems to improve the efficiency of our rigs and reduce environmental impact, from the \nintroduction of our Super Single rig in the 1990\u2019s to the commercialization of AlphaAutomationTM in \n2019. Over 40% of our active fleet is equipped to operate with natural gas. In 2021, we introduced \nour EverGreenTM Suite of Environmental Solutions with several products and apps to help our \ncustomers measure and reduce their emissions during drilling operations. \nWe believe geothermal energy will be an important energy component in the net zero global energy \nmix. Precision has participated in geothermal projects for the past 25 years and in early 2022, \nPrecision increased its commitment to geothermal energy with a direct investment in EavorTM, a \ngeothermal technology corporation. We are also excited to partner with Cornell University and \nthe U.S. Department of Energy to drill an exploratory geothermal well in Ithaca, NY with a Precision \nEverGreen\u2122 zero emissions rig.\nWe view our employees and the communities where we operate as part of the Precision family \nand offer training programs, employee development opportunities, family events, and community \nparticipation events that ensure Precision Drilling is both a great place to work and a strong \nKEVIN NEVEU\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\npartner within our communities. Our focused efforts in training, safety, diversity, equity, inclusion, \nharassment prevention, and community engagement were strengthened in 2021 following the \neasing of the pandemic restrictions. In 2021 we implemented Serious Injury and Fatality incident \n(SIF) as a key safety metric and have incorporated a SIF reduction target into our safety planning.\nPrecision\u2019s Board of Directors and management believe exceptional corporate governance is \nessential and aligns with our strategy of operational discipline.

The core of the Company's business is to provide our cooperative \nclinics with professional administrative supports and services including brand licensing, location assessment, store \nrenovation and expansion, space and equipment leasing, drug and medical supply sales, and other general affairs. \nUVB has also assisted cooperative clinics in obtaining a number of national and international recognitions and \ncertifications over years, such as SNQ (Symbol of National Quality), ISO9000 and the significant JCI (Joint \nCommission International) Accreditation. Together with our cooperative clinics, we are committed to bringing the \nbest quality of medical care and improving vision health for the public. \n \nUVB\u2019s management is teamed with professionals from ophthalmology as well as business administration \nbackgrounds. Having a deep and thorough understanding of the vision health industry, we believes that the \noutdated approaches of medical care being cold, serious, and rigid should be injected with more personal touch \nand respect. Therefore, UVB is dedicated to offering patients a more comfortable and satisfying experience when \nreceiving treatments at our cooperative clinics. Meanwhile, to make it a one stop shopping convenience for \ncustomers, we integrate self-operated optical services and products with medical care from the cooperative clinics, \nmaking vision health easier and better. \n \nIn adherence to the mission of improving medical quality and sustainable development with our cooperative clinics, \nUVB has taken concerted efforts for the continuous growth in 2021.

The Iberdrola Group is a multinational energy corporation based in \nBilbao, Spain. The Group was established in 1992 and has since then grown into one of the \nlargest energy groups worldwide. The Group\u2019s activities range from the production of electricity \nfrom conventional and renewable resources and the sale and purchase of electricity and gas in \nthe wholesale markets, to the transmission and distribution of electricity and gas. It is predom-\ninantly active in Brazil, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States of America, but \nalso has a smaller presence in many other countries.  \nDuring the 2021 business year Iberdrola generated revenues of EUR 39,114 million (2020: EUR \n33,145 million), EBITDA of EUR 11,516 million (2020: EUR 9,516 million), EBIT of EUR 7,326 million \n(2020: EUR 5,551 million) and net profit of EUR 4,352 million (2020: EUR 3,952 million). \nRating result \nThe current unsolicited corporate issuer rating of Iberdrola S.A. attests a good level of credit-\nworthiness representing a low to medium default risk. The main positive factors contributing to \nthe rating result are Iberdrola\u2019s balanced financial profile, as well as its large amount of regu-\nlated revenues and long-term contracts (PPA\u2019s), which significantly reduces market price and \nvolume risks. Furthermore, the geographically diversified asset base and income generation \nalso contributes positively to the current rating result. Regulatory risks, particularly with regard \nto the Networks business, are for a large extent mitigated due to the high number of different \nregulatory regimes. The increasing capacity in renewables increases exposure to adverse \nweather conditions. However, this is to a large extent mitigated by a high degree of diversifica-\ntion in terms of geography and energy source (Wind, Hydro, Solar). \nRating object \nRating information \nIberdrola S.A.  \n \nCreditreform ID: \n2000000597 \nIncorporation:   \n1992 \nBased in:  \nBilbao, Spain \nMain (Industry): \nEnergy distribution, generation and transmission \nCEO: \n                 Jos\u00e9 Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Gal\u00e1n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRating objects: \nLong-term Corporate issuer Rating: Iberdrola S.A. \nLong-term Corporate Issuer Rating: Rating Iberdrola International B.V. \nLong-term Corporate Issuer Rating: Iberdrola Finanzas S.A.U. \nLong-term Corporate Issuer Rating: Iberdrola Finance Ireland DAC \nLong-term Local Currency Senior Unsecured Issues, issued by Iberdrola International \nB.V. \nLong-term Local Currency Senior Unsecured Issues, issued by Iberdrola Finanzas S.A.U. \nLong-term Local Currency Senior Unsecured Issues, issued by Iberdrola Finance Ire-\nland DAC \n SME / Corporate Issuer Rating: \n BBB+ / stable \nType: \nUpdate \nUnsolicited \nPublic rating \n LT LC Senior Unsecured Issues,:  \n BBB+ / stable \nOther:  \nn.r. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRating date: \n19 October 2022 \nMonitoring until: \nwithdrawal of the rating \nRating methodology: CRA \u201cCorporate Ratings\u201c \nCRA \u201cNon-Financial Corporate Issue Ratings\u201c \nCRA \u201cRating Criteria and Definitions\u201c \nRating history:  www.creditreform-rating.de \nContent \n \nSummary ....................................... 1 \nRelevant rating factors ................. 2 \nBusiness \ndevelopment \nand \noutlook .......................................... 5 \nStructural risk ............................... 7 \nBusiness risk ................................. 8 \nFinancial risk ............................... 10 \nFinancial ratio analysis ............... 15 \nAnalysts \n \nRudger van Mook \nLead Analyst \nR.vanMook@creditreform-rating.de \n \n \nArtur Kapica \nCo-Analyst \nA.Kapica@creditreform-rating.de \n \n \n \nNeuss, Germany \n\n \n\u00a9 Creditreform Rating AG 2022 \n19 October 2022 \n2/20 \nCreditreform Corporate Issuer / Issue Rating \nIberdrola S.A. \n \nThe current volatility on European energy markets have not had a significant effect on the \nGroup\u2019s performance as a whole.

Nevertheless, in order to retain its leadership position in the energy transition, Iberdrola \nwill invest EUR 75 billion in the period between 2020 and 2025 and EUR 150 billion in the period \nup to 2030 to finance the continuance of its energy transition.

This has been a \ncritical factor in ensuring our continued success. \nAs the regulatory environment continues to expand, \nwe have seen numerous developments, including the \nimplementation of the Norwegian Transparency Act \nand the inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions \nTrading Systems (EU ETS). At Golden Ocean, we \nsupport these developments as we see them as enablers \nfor a more balanced sustainability landscape, which \ncorresponds with our commitment to ensuring ESG \nrisks and opportunities remain at the core of our \nbusiness strategy.\nWe have maintained a strategic focus on digitization to \nensure we have accessible ESG data. This investment \nallows us to extract relevant vessel performance data \nfrom our digital ESG management platform whenever \nwe need it, enabling data-driven decision-making. This \npermits us to optimize our operations to increase fuel \nefficiency and reduce emissions. Moreover, it provides \nour Board of Directors (BoD) with the necessary \ninformation to discuss ESG topics at BoD meetings, \nensuring that we stay on top of our performance. \nOur investment in maintaining a modern, energy-\nefficient fleet enables us to be ambitious in our \nemissions reduction targets. We have set targets for \nscope 1 emission reduction and aim to reduce our \nCarbon Intensity Indicator (CII) values by 15% by \n2026 and 30% by 2030, compared to 2019. We have \nalso set an ambition to reach net-zero by 2050. The \nstrength of our young fleet, with an average age of 6.5 \nyears and superior fuel economics, is one of the core \nenvironmental pillars of our sustainability strategy. \nOur energy efficiency project \u2013 \u201cDecarbonization \njourney toward IMO 2030-2050\u201d \u2013 has provided us \nwith a solid basis for assessing our operations, with a \nparticular focus on how to further optimize our fleet to \nmeet our targets. To this end, in the past 24 months, we \nhave sold 11 older vessels and acquired or contracted \n24 modern vessels. This acquisition strengthens \nour position as one of the world\u2019s largest dry bulk \ncompanies, while also increasing the fuel efficiency \nof our fleet and reducing our emissions profile. As a \nresult, we are making significant progress towards our \nemission reduction targets \nWe will continue to assess our operations and \ninvestment strategies in light of the EU Taxonomy \nregulation and its technical screening criteria to \nensure that we stay an attractive business partner. \nWith this in mind, we have applied for a sustainability-\nlinked bond to help support Golden Ocean in the \nimplementation of its sustainability strategy.\nIn add", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

We believe that this allows our investors to put their financial assets to work delivering impact, while \nsignaling to companies that investors will support their efforts to build a better business and a better world. \n \nSecond, we engage directly with portfolio companies through actively voting proxies, portfolio-wide campaigns, \nand company-specific requests, all with the goal of driving companies to improve their sustainable business \npractices and disclosures.  \n \nThird, we advocate for broader change within the capital markets and business community via our thought \nleadership work.

There were no signifi\u00ad\ncant impacts either in terms of management of liquidity, which remained solid and stable, or in terms of strategic \nobjectives and direction, characterised by an increasing integration of sustainability into the business mod\u00ad\nel. Established from the outset as a company oriented towards long-term sustainable growth, Fineco has in fact \ncontinued to operate in line with its corporate purpose: \u201cto support clients in the responsible management of \ntheir savings in order to create the conditions for a more prosperous and fairer society\u201d. \nThis goal is pursued through the Group\u2019s continuous investment in the three pillars of transparency, efficiency \nand innovation, which have always guided our strategy and our growth journey, offering customers excellent \nservices and products at a fair price within the three integrated business areas of banking, investing and bro\u00ad\nkerage.\nThe constant look to the future that guides business decisions is also the cornerstone of our approach to sus\u00ad\ntainability. Accordingly, in 2022 we adopted the Net Zero Commitment, setting ourselves the important goal \nof achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. \nThe commitment to combating climate change is part of the Group\u2019s subscription to the United Nations sus\u00ad\ntainability initiatives \u2013 namely the Principles of the Global Compact, the Principles for Responsible Banking \nand the Principles for Responsible Investment \u2013 and is part of the ESG Plan, which saw the achievement of \nimportant milestones during the year. In terms of client offering, Fineco Asset Management has strengthened \nits range of ESG products and the integration of environmental, social and governance criteria into its invest\u00ad\nment management activities. The Bank has also expanded the availability of ESG-rated funds and the range of \nESG-rated financial products, meeting the important challenge of offering customers products and services that \nare increasingly aligned to their sustainability preferences. \nIn September 2022, FinecoBank obtained EMAS Registration, a recognition that certifies the excellence of the \nEnvironmental Management System, implemented throughout the Italian offices and Fineco Centers accord\u00ad\ning to the requirements of the European EMAS Regulation. \nIn the knowledge that the ability to innovate and continuous evolution cannot be separated from the nurturing \n\n5\nof human capital and the richness derived from the diversity of its composition, we have continued to invest in \nthe growth of our employees and personal financial advisors an", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 26.0}}}}

To deliver on the objectives that we established in our previous report, SMP has \nmade significant enhancements to our environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) \nprofile. During 2022, we prioritized the following initiatives to advance our commitment to \nbeing environmentally and socially responsible:\n\u2022\t\nidentify and implement practices that contribute to a greener car parc;\n\u2022\t\nreduce our carbon footprint and make progress towards our ambition to achieve net-\nzero greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions by 2050;\n\u2022\t\nenhance our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging programs; \n\u2022\t\nenhance employee training, development, retention, while prioritizing their health and \nsafety; \n\u2022\t\nimprove the diversity of our Board of Directors; \n\u2022\t\nensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, while furthering our \ncommitment to align our ESG reporting with established reporting standards; and\n\u2022\t\nappointed a director of global sustainability to analyze opportunities, develop strategies \nand monitor our environmental supply chain efforts worldwide.\n\t\n\t\nWe believe that these initiatives, and the integration of a sustainable approach to our \nbusiness, will provide long-term value to our Company, stakeholders, and the communities \nwithin which we operate.\n\t\n\t\nOver the 100-plus years that we have been in business, we have challenged ourselves \nto take advantage of the opportunities that technological advancements have presented \nto us. Today, SMP is prepared to meet the growing demand for high-quality replacement \nparts of hybrid and electric vehicles through our broad offerings of conventional and future-\noriented technologies. We have invested in an original equipment manufacturer of electric \ndrive compressors for HVAC and battery cooling in electric and hybrid vehicles. Additionally, \nin 2022 alone, we\u2019ve expanded our product offering through the introduction of more than \n1,400 new parts for powertrain-neutral applications and another 300 components for \nhybrid and electric vehicles. Our engineers have also successfully developed fuel injectors \nfor engines that use hydrogen, compressed natural gas, and liquid natural gas to replace \ndiesel fuel with clean-burning alternatives. Additionally, our remanufacturing program \nrecycles certain used automotive parts, producing same-as-new components that promote \nsustainable manufacturing practices and contribute to a cleaner car parc.\n\t\n\t\nWe also have continued to challenge ourselves to identify and implement solutions \nto reduce our environmental impact while achieving our business objectives. In our 2021 \nA MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO\nThough we recognize the challenges that lie ahead, we remain \ncommitted to leveraging sustainability as a catalyst for positive \nchange both within our organization and in the communities \nwithin which we operate.\n\n2022 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n4\nSustainability Report, we announced our ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by \n2050. To that end, we have partnered with third-parties to help us track our GHG emissions \nand develop a roadmap to achieve our reduction targets. We are also in the process of \ntransitioning our sales force vehicles to hybrid electric vehicles to reduce fuel costs and \nScope 1 GHG emissions. In 2022, facility upgrades aimed at improving energy efficiency \nand reducing energy usage have helped us reduce our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG \nemissions (intensity) by 11% compared to 2021 and 30% compared to 2019.

These efforts make it possible \nfor the next generation of aerospace workers \nto continue to enjoy rewarding careers, \nstrengthen the fabric of the communities where \nwe operate, and collaborate within our industry \nfor environmental stewardship (E), social \nprogress (S) and transparent governance (G).\nBoeing\u2019s mission is to protect, connect and \nexplore our world and beyond. Every day, we \nare dedicated to carrying out our mission \u2014 \nsafely and sustainably. Boeing is pursuing \nsustainable aerospace together because we \nknow it is an imperative and because our \nteammates are committed to making the \nworld better for future generations.\nThroughout Boeing\u2019s long history, we have \nlooked for ways to enhance sustainability in \neverything we do. This commitment to \ninnovate is deeply rooted in our core values, \nwhere we continue to reinforce safety as our \ntop priority, strive for first-time quality and hold \nourselves to the highest ethical standards to \nsupport a more sustainable future.\nBy 2050, our industry sees a world where air \ntravel will carry over 10 billion passengers a \nyear, support 180 million jobs and generate \nnearly $9 trillion in economic activity, all while \nfurthering our goal of minimizing the impact \non our planet and striving to achieve the \ncommercial aviation industry\u2019s ambition \nof net-zero carbon emissions. Aerospace also \ncontinues to be essential to national security, \nhumanitarian and peacekeeping efforts around \nthe globe. We are committed to preserving the \nsocietal, security and economic benefits of our \nindustry, safely and sustainably. \nAdvancing the future of flight and improving \nthe world for future generations requires a \nmulti-faceted approach. Our focus on ESG is \nembedded in our culture and our stakeholders\u2019 \nexpectations, including our current and \nfuture employees, customers, regulators, \nsuppliers, communities and investors.\nEnvironmental Stewardship\nTo address climate change, Boeing continues \nto collaborate with partners across the globe \non innovation and clean technology to get \ncommercial aviation to net-zero carbon \nemissions. We\u2019re finding more efficient ways \nfor our commercial and defense customers to \noperate their fleets, and we\u2019re investing heavily \nin sustainable aviation fuels, considered the \nsafest and most measurable solution to reduce \naviation carbon emissions over the next 20 \nto 30 years. We continue to test the latest \ntechnologies to cut emissions, reduce noise \nand enhance safety with our ecoDemonstrator \nprogram, which celebrates its 10th anniversary \nthis year, while investing in and demonstrating \nalternative fuel solutions to inform the future \nof flight. We are committed to maintaining \nnet-zero carbon emissions within our \noperations as we advance the design-for-\nenvironment view of our defense and \ncommercial products and build sustainability \ninto every step of our product life cycle. \nDave Calhoun, President and CEO\n2022 Sustainability Report  3\nContents\nPeople\nIntroduction\nCommunities\nO", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

To meet this commitment, we have \ndeveloped a robust sustainability program that addresses \nour operations, while also seeking to help building owners \nand occupants achieve their own sustainability goals. Our \ncommitment and the work we do in these areas align with \nour history of innovation and customer focus, as well as \nwith our company purpose to make a positive difference \nin the spaces where we live, work, learn, heal and play.\nThe last several years have demonstrated that the need \nfor healthy indoor environments has never been greater. \nAt Armstrong, we understand that the ceilings and walls that \nsurround us are essential links to our health and well-being. With \npeople spending nearly 90% of their time indoors, we believe it \nis more important than ever to shape this experience positively. \nTogether, the three pillars of our sustainability program\u2014\nProduct, Planet and People\u2014help us identify and address \nthe challenges and opportunities ahead. In this 2023 report, \nwe update our progress within the pillars toward our 2030 \ntargets and highlight key initiatives and achievements.\nOur commitment to sustainability means working to minimize \nthe impacts of the built environment to our existing natural \nworld. Given that nearly 40% of global emissions come from \nbuildings, our goals prioritize the protection of the environment \nfor future generations. This includes our 2030 greenhouse \ngas (GHG) reduction targets that the Science Based Target \nInitiative (SBTi) approved in 2022. We are also making \ninvestments throughout our operations to increase efficiency \nand reduce reliance on nonrenewable resources. As of the \nend of 2022, we had reduced our carbon footprint by 13% \nfrom 2019 levels and increased our use of renewable \nelectricity to 13% of total usage. \nWe are also investing in sustainable and circular design \npractices to reduce the environmental impact of the products \nand solutions we provide. By reducing our reliance on finite \nresources, minimizing waste and pollution, and designing \nresilient infrastructure that can adapt to our planet\u2019s changing \nneeds, we have the potential to meaningfully contribute \nto the shift from a linear economy to a circular economy. \nWe continue to pursue increased product transparency \nand to expand our SUSTAIN\u00ae portfolio of products that meet \nthe industry\u2019s most stringent sustainability criteria. We are \nalso proud of our long-standing Ceilings Recycling Program. \nSince 1999, we have diverted over 1.2 million tons of virgin raw \nmaterial from landfills. We continue to drive circularity in our \noperations, with customers and throughout our value chain. \nWe are also innovating to support greater building efficiency. \nA key highlight is the development of an energy-saving \nsystem that combines the DynaMax\u00ae grid systems for data \ncenters with our ULTIMA\u00ae AIRASSURE\u00ae gasketed ceiling. In \n2022, we validated that these systems installed in data center \nenvironments can deliver energy savings of up to 40 cents \nper square foot each year. With the average data center being \n100,000 square feet and reaching 1 million square feet for \nmega centers, the magnitude of savings is significant.  \nWe also know that healthy spaces and healthy communities \ngo hand in hand. Our commitment to health and safety begins \nwithin our own walls and extends to the communities we serve. \nBy ", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Renewable energy \ninvestment now clearly exceeds fossil fuel investment, while the electrification of energy users is spreading. We still expect \nworld fossil fuel consumption to peak in 2023. With both the supply of clean energy and the electrification taking off, the \npolicy focus will turn to controlling supply chains and securing access to key materials. \nSustainable Debt Market Update: Weakness extends into 2023 ................................................................................................ 9 \nSustainability-labelled debt issuance continues to drift lower. The first four months of 2023 saw sustainable debt issuance \ndecline to USD 450bn, down from 543bn the same period last year. Similarly, flows into SRI/ESG-labelled funds for both \nbonds and equities have thus levelled off over the past 18 months. Both weaknesses are mostly due to a sudden drop in the \nUS sustainable loan market and the country\u2019s political conflict about ESG investing. Green bonds continue to increase \nglobally and in Europe, where ESG is less politically embattled, fund flows continue to support the demand side. \nDevelopment of the Nordic BECCS Market ..................................................................................................................................... 12 \nThe Nordic region is uniquely placed to be a major source of high-quality carbon removals for the burgeoning voluntary \ncarbon market. Aker Carbon Capture is working with biogenic CO2 emitters across the region on large scale carbon \nremovals projects. However, lack of clarity around interpretations of Paris Agreement Article 6 is leading to uncertainty on \nthe buy and supply side. A unified understanding on the principles of carbon removal accounting towards national NDCs \nand corporate Net-Zero strategies is paramount.   \nCarbon removal in aviation ................................................................................................................................................................. 15 \nAirbus is fully committed to contributing to reaching the net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 target set by the aviation \nindustry. To reach this target, carbon removal technologies, together with hydrogen, are promising complementary \nsolutions to biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel. As carbon removal becomes increasingly commoditized, it is essential \nthat a robust, liquid, and transparent market is established to ensure its effectiveness.   \nEU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: An overview of the EU\u2019s \u201ccarbon border tax\u201d.................................................. 18 \nThe EU\u2019s new Carbon Boarder Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) aims to reduce the competitive disadvantage faced by EU \nindustries subject to stringent emissions regulations. From 2026, importers of cement, iron and steel, aluminum, fertilizers, \nelectricity, and hydrogen into the EU will have to pay the equivalent price of the EU ETS system. The new tariff is likely to \nincrease the costs for carbon-intensive goods imported into the EU and carry the risk of trade disputes. EU industries in the \nscope of CBAM may benefit from the new measure but require additional incentives to adopt zero-emission solutions.  \nThe Green Bond Editorial Team ......................................................................................................................................................... 20 \nContacts at SEB ..................................................................................................................................................................................... 21 \n \n \n \n\nClimate & Sustainable Finance Research \n08 June 2023\n \n3\n \nLetter to the reader \n \nDear reader, \n \nLet me start by thanking Thomas Thygesen, Elizabeth \nMathiesen and Tine Vist for their help in ensuring that The \nGreen Bond publication has been mainstreamed and \nintegrated into SEB\u2019s frames through their persistent and \nsolid leadership over the past 4 years!  \nThe financial market is an interesting place ", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"renewable_energy_percent": 50.0}}}}

Main events of half-year ended 30 September 2023  \n \n1.1. Trigger event assessment for assets impairment test  \n \nAlstom disclosed preliminary financial information for its first half of fiscal year 2023/24, ending September 30 2023, \nas well as an updated guidance regarding the full year 2023/24 (as disclosed in the press release dated 4 October \n2023). Following this announcement, Alstom\u2019s share price has significantly decreased, leading to a market \ncapitalization lower than the carrying amount of Alstom\u2019s net assets. As per IAS 36, this situation has been considered \nas a trigger event to reperform impairment test on goodwill (detailed in Note 11.1). The impairment test confirmed \nthat the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying value at 30 September 2023, therefore no impairment loss was \nrecognized on Goodwill over the period. \nOn other assets: technology and other intangible assets (amortised assets), as well as deferred taxes (see Note 8), \nimpairment tests are reviewed at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that they might be \nimpaired. Based on its reasonable estimates, the visibility available and previous enlarged sensitivity analyses \nperformed in March 2023, Alstom has not identified any trigger event indicating that any assets should be impaired at \nthe end of September 2023. \n \n1.2. Uncertainties linked to the current economic and political context \n \nThe current economic and political context creates uncertainties on business activities (namely inflation, price volatility \nof certain commodities, energy, increases of interest rates, supply chain disruptions or electronic components \nshortage\u2026). Nevertheless, the Group carefully follows and monitors the potential increase in its cost structures (raw \nmaterials prices, supply chain and wages inflation), being quite well protected (73% of the backlog being covered by \nprice escalation clauses on global inflation - commodities, energy and labour indexes). \n \n1.3. One Alstom team - Agile, Inclusive and Responsible \n \nMore than ever, decarbonization is at the heart of Alstom\u2019s strategy. The Group is reducing its own direct and indirect \nemissions (Scope 1 & 2) and is also committed to work with suppliers and customers (Scope 3) to contribute to Net \nZero carbon in the mobility sector. Alstom CO2 emissions reduction targets had been validated on the 6th of July 2023 \nby the independent Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as in line with requirements to reach Paris Agreement \ncommitments.  \nThe supply of electricity from renewable sources has also been expanded. Alstom signed a significant Power Purchase \nAgreement focused on solar development in Spain. The solar farm is expected to begin operations early 2025 with a \n10-years contract. The project will cover the equivalent of 80% of Alstom\u2019s electricity consumption in Europe, so this is \na major step in reaching our target of 100% electricity consumption from renewables. \nAlstom\u2019s Corporate Social Responsibility performance is regularly evaluated by various rating agencies; the Group \nmaintained its presence among the CAC40 ESG index for the 3rd consecutive year. Alstom improved is scoring to \nECOVADIS questionnaire with a score of 77/100 and kept AA score with MSCI agency.

The ESG \nindicators also show that the six GCC countries, all of which are \noil-producing nations, are serious and committed in their efforts \ntowards fostering and integrating green and sustainable economy, \nand suggest that the direction of travel in the region may be towards \nfurther harmonization of sustainability-related regulations. \nThis alert memorandum briefly summarises the structure and \npurpose of the GCC\u2019s new ESG disclosure guidance, and places \nthem in the wider context of global emerging regulations on ESG \ndisclosures for listed companies.  \nIf you have any questions concerning \nthis memorandum, please reach out to \nyour regular firm contact or the \nfollowing authors \n \nABU DH ABI  \nChris Macbeth \n+971 2 412 1730 \ncmacbeth@cgsh.com \nLynn Ammar \n+971 2 412 1714 \nlammar@cgsh.com  \nMisthura Otubu \n+971 2 412 1813 \nmotubu@cgsh.com \nHiba Younes \n+971 2 412 1712 \nhyounes@cgsh.com  \nRO ME  \nClara Cibrario Assereto \n+39 06 6952 2225 \nccibrarioassereto@cgsh.com \n \n\nALERT  ME MO RA ND U M  \n \n2\nI. \nThe GCC\u2019s unified ESG disclosure \nguidance \nUnified GCC sustainability disclosure guidance \nOn January 9, 2023, the Exchanges Committee of the \nGCC launched a set of unified sustainability disclosure \nindicators, which may be adopted by all listed \ncompanies across the region.   \nThe new guidance creates ESG indicators across all \n3 pillars of sustainability: Environment (e.g. GHG \nemissions and climate risk mitigation), Social (e.g. \nchild labor and global health), and Governance (e.g. \nboard diversity and sustainability reporting). They \ncomprise 29 indicators aligned with the World \nFederation of Exchanges (\u201cWFE\u201d) and Sustainable \nStock Exchanges (\u201cSSE\u201d) Initiative. Please refer to the \ntable below for a full list of the ESG indicators and \ntheir corresponding calculations.  \nThe WFE operates as the global industry association \nfor exchanges and clearing houses worldwide. \nMembers of the WFE include the Abu Dhabi \nSecurities Exchange (\u201cADX\u201d), Dubai Financial \nMarket (\u201cDFM\u201d), as well as other stock exchanges in \nthe GCC region. The SSE on the other hand provides \nan avenue for examining how exchanges and relevant \nstakeholders (such as listed companies, investors, and \nregulators) can boost corporate transparency, enhance \nESG initiatives, and encourage sustainable investment.  \nThe GCC indicators are mapped against the Global \nReporting Initiative (\u201cGRI\u201d)\u2019s sector-agnostic general \nstandards. The GRI, an international, not-for-profit \norganization, has developed a set of guidelines that are \nused by thousands of corporate and public sector \nreporting entities in over 90 countries. \nPre-existing local sustainability disclosure regimes \nStock exchanges in the Gulf region adopted their own \nindividual sustainability disclosure standards prior to \nthe implementation of the unified guidance.  \n \n1 Our alert memorandum on the proposed ADGM \nsustainable finance regulatory framework is accessible here. \nOnce in place, the framework will amend (among others) \nIn the United Arab Emirates (\u201cUAE\u201d), each of the \nthree stock exchanges (the ADX, DFM, and Nasdaq \nDubai) has its own voluntary ESG disclosure \nguidance. On the regulatory front, financial free zones \nsuch as the Abu Dhabi Global Market (the \u201cADGM\u201d) \nhave also proposed their own disclosure guidance. 1  \nAlthough the GCC\u2019s new indicators are neither a \ncomprehensive reporting framework nor a replacement \nfor the existing disclosure standards, they should \nfacilitate uniformity in ESG reporting by listed \ncompanies all across the region.  \nWhilst the Exchanges Committee is not a regulator, the \nnew unified ESG guidance are an indicator t", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Our analysis of \nfinanced emissions considers on-balance sheet financing, including project finance and direct lending, as well as \nfinancing we help clients access through capital markets activities. Given the different nature of these two forms of financing, we distinguish between \u2018on\n-balance sheet financed\u2019 and \u2018facilitated\u2019 \nemissions where necessary in our \nreporting.  \nThe methodology and data used to assess financed emissions and set targets is new and evolving, and we expect \nindustry guidance, market practice, and regulations to continue to change. We plan to refine our analysis using the \ndata sources and methodologies available for the sectors we analyse, including, among others, the Science Based Targets initiative (\u2018SBTi\u2019) and the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (\u2018PACTA\u2019) methodology.\n \nFinanced emissions link the financing we provide to our customers and their activities in the real economy, helping to provide an indication of the greenhouse gas (\u2018GHG\u2019) emissions associated with those activities. They\n form part of our \nScope 3 emissions, which includes emissions associated with the use of a company\u2019s\n products and services.  We define \u2018counterparty\u2019 as being an individual counterparty to a loan or transaction and \u201ccounterparty group\u201d as being a \ngroup of connected counterparties. \nFor further details of our approach to assessing financed emissions and target setting, see our Net Zero Aligned \nFinance Approach Update at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-and-responsible-business/esg-reporting-centre. \nWe have adopted a three-step methodology to the judgements defined by industry recommendations1 for \ncomparability and transparency (see Table 1).

Today, stakeholders expect companies not \nonly to generate value for their shareholders and employees but also for society and \nthe environment in which they operate. In the context of social and economic recovery \nfrom the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, environmental protection, climate change \naction and social equity are essential elements in the transformation toward a low-\ncarbon and resource-efficient economy. \nOne of the main conclusions we could draw from the last Climate Summit in Glasgow, \nCOP26, was the consensus among politicians, industry, customers and society in \ngeneral on the need to accelerate the pace of decarbonization. This inertia is driving \nthe transformation of all economic sectors, especially the industrial sectors, where the \nchange in the energy mix plays a crucial role. \nIf we look at the industries to which Gonvarri\u2019s activity has traditionally been linked, \nthe impact of this transformation is global and intense. The automotive industry is \nmoving unstoppable toward electrification and mobility services; steel production is \nseeing growing interest in low-emission steel, as it prepares for a true \u201cGreen Steel\u201d \nrevolution. In relation to renewables, the current context of war between Ukraine and \nRussia, where the renewed interest of many European countries in reducing their \ndependence on Russian-origin natural gas is leading them to review their energy \nand security of supply policies by setting new and more ambitious renewable energy \ntargets for 2030, is a major conditioning factor.\nLetter from the Chairman\nJon Riberas\nenvironmental protection, climate \nchange action and social equity \nare essential elements in the \ntransformation toward a low-carbon \nand resource-efficient economy\n102-14\nGonvarri\nEnvironmental\nSocial\nGovernment\nValue creation and sustainable management.

The profitability of business must be sustainable over \ntime, and in the future we see that regulatory restrictions, financial markets and \nsociety in general are designing new very restrictive boundary conditions with CO2 \nemissions. This is why the consolidation of our Carbon-Neutral Plan is a strategic \npriority for the coming years, which has also led us to commit to the Science Based \nTargets initiative and its Net-Zero framework, which establishes the highest level of \nambition in the reduction of CO2 emissions. \nTaking advantage of the opportunities offered by this energy transition will help \nus to: reduce the environmental impact of our energy consumption, limit our \ndependence on non-native energy resources and explore new business areas linked \nto this new economy. The green economy poses changes in the production and \nconsumption models, and to the extent that we can anticipate these changes, we \nwill take advantage of the opportunities that this transition offers us.\nAt Gonvarri, 2021 also marked a change in the Strategic Plan. The Plan for the 2019-\n2021 period has already been defined as one of its pillars the drive for growth and \ndiversification of technological and innovative projects in markets with development \npotential. This pillar is still present in the new 22-24 Strategic Plan that, with the \nalways fundamental reference of the Sustainability Policy, which helps us become \naware of the challenges facing society, are the guide that directs our decisions and \nactions. \nIn this context, I present once again this year\u2019s Sustainability Report for the 2021 \nfinancial year, where we renew and maintain our commitment to the Global Compact, \npromoting compliance with the 10 Universal Principles and aligned with the \nSustainable Development Goals. \nFinally, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the work and dedication of those \npeople who make it possible for Gonvarri to continue to advance steadily in its \nbusiness project.

According to the latest Carbon \nDisclosure Project (CDP) report, data disclosed by the majority of the operators indicate \nthat a significant portion of emissions are generated in the value chain. This is obviously \ngreater for the network operators that have managed to switch fully to renewable energy \nin their operations. These emissions are part of those termed \u2018scope 3\u2019 (a company\u2019s in- \ndirect emissions from its supply chain and from the use of its products by its customers) \naccording to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Sustainable supply chains should also \nbe guided by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, with \nenvironmental, economic, and social considerations incorporated into all of the supply \nchain operation areas. \nIn this publication, the key challenges mobile operators face in developing sustainable \nsupply chains are outlined. A review of the emerging regulatory and standards environ\u00ad\nment is conducted and approaches and best practices in developing sustainable supply \nchains are identified by relating the emerging business and regulatory environment to \nexamples of the changes that operators and their supply chain partners may need to \nmake both at a strategic and operational level. The key conclusion is: Integrating sustai\u00ad\nnability goals into the operator\u2019s core objectives is of key importance as well as selecting \nsuppliers whose own sustainability strategies are aligned with these goals.\nFinally, a practical checklist (Annex A) based on the best practices in the industry is provided \nto support operators in developing a sustainable procurement strategy. Examples from \nacross the industry are included that highlight that companies are already embracing \nmany of the concepts identified in this report. \n\n5\nCONTENTS\n01\n06\n02\n07\n03\n08\n04\n09\n05\n10\nINTRODUCTION.................................................. 6-7\nCONCLUSIONS...............................................  20-21\nSUSTAINABLE SUPPLY \nCHAIN CHALLENGES...................................... 8-9\nANNEX A: \nGUIDE FOR TELCOS TO PROCURE \nSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS................ 22-23\nSUPPLY CHAIN \nEMISSIONS REDUCTION \nLEVERS FOR TELCOS.................................10-11\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.............................24\nSUPPLY CHAIN REGULATORY \nENVIRONMENT..............................................12-13\nREFERENCES................................................................25\nCRITICAL SUCCESS \nFACTORS FOR SUPPLY CHAIN \nSUSTAINABILITY...........................................14-19\nBEST PRACTICES.....................................................26\n5.1 Developing ESG goals.............................................14\n5.2 Strategy and aligning with ESG goals.............15\n5.3 New Processes............................................................15\n5.3.1 Supply Chain Management \nand Procurements............................................................16\n5.3.2 Product / Service Development / \nDevices....................................................................................16\n5.3.3 Marketing and Communications..................18\n5.3.4 Logistics......................................................................18\n5.3.5 People and Human Resources......................19\n5.3.6 Networks...................................................", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

The switch from a linear, throwaway society to a circular \neconomy in which resources are no longer wasted is an absolute pri-\nority. Now, for the second time, we share news of key progress made \nand the challenges we face in the FREITAG Impact Report. It provides \ninsights into how we align our overall strategic goals, projects and \ndaily work with our overarching purpose: \u00abIntelligent design for a cir-\ncular future\u00bb.\nThe year 2022 was marked by political events worldwide and the en-\nsuing economic instability. On a human level, the war in Ukraine has \nhad massive repercussions. We thus made a snap decision to use a \nsubstantial portion of the \u00abFREITAG Nonprofit Fund\u00bb for charitable \npurposes in support of emergency humanitarian aid in Ukraine. On a \nbusiness level, the rising costs caused by the war presented us with \nchallenges along the entire value chain. Apart from this, it is becom-\ning increasingly difficult to source discarded truck tarps of suitable \nquality. At the same time, we were faced with the aftermath of the \nCorona pandemic and China\u2019s zero-Covid policy, which was still caus-\ning supply shortages and, consequently, delivery delays in our supply \nchain. \nFREITAG has been aware of its corporate responsibility since its \nfoundation and today unwaveringly focuses on striking a balance \nbetween people, planet and profitability. Internally, we have creat-\ned a code of conduct for the F-Crew with the \u00abCulture Code\u00bb and \nlaunched several formats to strengthen the resilience and mental \nhealth of all FREITAG employees. In 2022, to make our supply chain \neven more transparent, we intensified the partnership-based dia-\nlogue with our long-standing producers and identified joint fields of \naction.\nWe were equally concerned with the importance and urgency of cli-\nmate change and the need for substantial emissions reductions. \nFREITAG has therefore committed to company-wide emissions re-\nductions that are in line with the scientifically based 1.5\u00b0C targets. To \nthis end, we have developed a roadmap and had our near-term emis-\nsions target by 2030 verified in accordance with the net-zero stand-\nards defined by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). At prod-\nuct and service level we have addressed the challenges of resource \nscarcity: Our innovative circular truck tarp project has resulted in two \nprototypes of the tarp of the future going on a first road test. With the \nCIRC-CASE smartphone protector, we have introduced our first circu-\nlar product with an accompanying take-back system.\nIn 2022, FREITAG took the principle of self-organization a step fur-\nther. Previously, formal responsibility for managing the outermost cir-\ncle of the company was on the shoulders of a single individual. This \ncentral position is now jointly handled by a collegial management \ncollective. This entrepreneurial and strategically thinking collective \nhas since developed a long-term corporate strategy that addresses \nand underpins the five ambitions outlined in the \u00abFREITAG Circularity \nRoadmap\u00bb, our sustainability strategy.\nHowever, FREITAG cannot achieve these circular ambitions alone. To \ndo so, we need partnerships that help us create recyclable materials \nand customers who value our products and extend their life by mak-\ning use of our circular services. And last but not least, we need the \nentire F-Crew to design and implement our products and services \nand to successfully anchor them in the market. Special thanks there-\nfore go to all FREITAG employees, whose daily efforts make a valua-\nble contribution to a circular future.\nWe hope that the FREITAG Impact Report will provide inspiring in-\nsights into our journey to becoming a circular company, offer starting \npoints for exchange and collaboration, and encourage us to work to-\ngether to realize our vision of a better, and more circular, world. \nZurich, Autumn 2023 \n \nBigna Salzmann, Sustainability & Compliance Officer \nAnna Kerschbaumer, Jean-G\u00e9r\u00f4me Carrey, Nora Kato, Peter Alge \nand Tanita Bohny*, Company Leaders\nPHOTO CREDIT: SIMON HABEGGER\n*TANITA BOHNY WAS ON MATERNITY LEAVE WHEN THE IMPACT REPORT WAS COMPILED.\n\n04\n1993\nIn search of a functional, water-repellent \nand robust bag, brothers Daniel and Mark-\nus Freitag develop the original version of \nthe ic", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 13.4}}}}

Introduction \n1.1. The Belgian Code on Corporate Governance \nThe corporate governance practices of Anheuser-Busch InBev are reflected in its Corporate Governance Charter,  \nwhich is available on https://www.ab-inbev.com/investors/corporate-governance/corporate-governance-documents.html. \nThe Charter is regularly updated. \nAnheuser-Busch InBev is a company incorporated under Belgian law with a primary listing on Euronext Brussels (Euronext: \nABI) and with secondary listings on the Mexico Stock Exchange (MEXBOL: ANB) and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange \n(JSE: ANH) (ISIN: BE0974293251) and with American Depositary Shares (\u201cADSs\u201d) listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \nAs a Belgian company with a primary listing on Euronext Brussels, Anheuser-Busch InBev adheres to the principles and \nprovisions of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code (www.corporategovernancecommittee.be) (\u201cthe Corporate \nGovernance Code\u201d), taking into account its specific status as a multinational group with secondary listings in Mexico and \nJohannesburg and with ADSs listed in New York.  \nIn line with AB InBev\u2019s specific shareholding structure and the global nature of its operations, the company has departed in \n2022 from the following soft-law principles of the Corporate Governance Code: \nPrinciple 4.19 of the Corporate Governance Code: \u201cthe Board should set up a nomination committee with the \nmajority of its members comprising independent non-executive board members\u201d - The Board of Directors appoints \nthe chairman and members of the Nomination Committee from among the directors. As the committee is composed \nexclusively of non-executive directors who are independent of management and free from any business relationship that \ncould materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment, the Board considers that the composition of this \ncommittee achieves the aim of Principle 4.19 of the Corporate Governance Code. \nPrinciple 7.6 of the Corporate Governance Code: \u201cA non-executive board member should receive part of their \nremuneration in the form of shares in the company. These shares should be held until at least one year after the \nnon-executive board member leaves the board and at least three years after the moment of award. However, no \nstock options should be granted to non-executive board members\u201d - The share-based component of the directors\u2019 \nremuneration is paid in the form of Restricted Stock Units. Such Restricted Stock Units vest after five years and, upon \nvesting, entitle their holders to one AB InBev share per Restricted Stock Unit (subject to any applicable withholdings). The \nshares delivered to directors upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units are not subject to a lock-up of three years after the \ndate of delivery and one year after the date of departure of the relevant director. However, the Board considers that the five-\nyear vesting period of the Restricted Stock Units fosters a sustainable and long-term commitment of the directors to \nshareholder value creation that addresses the goal of Principle 7.6 of the Corporate Governance Code. \n1.2. New York Stock Exchange Listing \nFurther to the New York Stock Exchange listing of ADSs representing ordinary shares of AB InBev, the New York Stock \nExchange Corporate Governance rules for Foreign Private Issuers are applicable to the company. AB InBev has also \nregistered under the US Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a result, it is also subject to the US Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002 and to certain US Securities laws and regulations relating to corporate governance. \n1.3. Specific Corporate Governance initiatives \n1.3.1. FOSTERING ETHICAL CONDUCT \nThe Board of Directors and management of AB InBev are committed to promoting and maintaining the highest standards of \nethical behavior and transparency. This guides everything that AB InBev does as an organization, and serves as its \nfoundation for creating a future with more cheers.   \nAB InBev has established ethical rules and internal codes and policies to reinforce this commitment. The Code of Business \nConduct sets out the ethical standards which all colleagues around the world are expected to adhere to and provides \nguidance for interactions with third parties. It requires colleagues to comply with all applicable laws, disclose any relevant \nconflicts of interests, to act in the best interests of the company, and conduct all dealings in an honest and ethical manner. \nIt covers confidentiality of information, limits on offering or accepting gifts or entertainment, and the appropriate use of the \ncompany\u2019s property. The Code of Business Conduct includes policies which define colleagues\u2019 responsibilities and expected \n\n \n \n \nAB InBev \u2013 Annual Report 2022 \uf0e7 3 \n \nbehavior, and includes the Global Anti-Corruption, Human Rights, Digital Ethics & Data Priva", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Thanks \nto this way of understanding our work, we have been able to \ntransform the trust shown by our customers into specific solutions \nto contribute to the revolution of the new mobility. With the same \nenthusiasm as we had on day one and \nwith our trademark refusal to conform, we want to go further: \npromoting the creation of value in our entire environment and \ndoing this while being proud of what we are today \nand what we will continue to be tomorrow. \n\n4\nGRUPO ANTOLIN | INTEGRATED REPORT 2021\nGo to contents\n1. Antolin today: A history of leadership\n1.1. \nConversation with the Chairman\n\t\u276fIn Grupo Antolin\u2019s last report, you summed up the 2020 \nfinancial year with two words: responsibility and solidarity. \nWhat words or what headline would you use to summarize \nGrupo Antolin\u2019s performance during 2021?\nThe 2021 financial year has been very complex for the entire industry as \na consequence of the global economic effects the pandemic has con-\ntinued to cause; the most significant being the disruption to the global \nsupply chain, but we should also not forget the inflationary pressure \nthrough raw materials and logistics. It is undoubtedly a challenging \nsituation, but the strength of large companies is being demonstrated at \nthis time and I believe that Grupo Antolin has been able to rise to the \noccasion. Thanks to our teams, who are the heart of our business, we \nhave once again shown our great capacity for adaptation, flexibility and \nefficiency in responding to this environment. \n\t\u276fA major milestone this year is approving the new \nenvironmental, social and governance objectives to continue \ndeveloping its sustainable business model. What has been \nconsidered when defining these and what does it mean for the \ncompany?\nThe approval of the new objectives is another very important step in \nour commitment to our activity helping in some way to build a fairer \nand better planet in all regards: environmental, ethical, respect for \nHuman Rights, development of talent in the new generations and \nmore. As companies we are not isolated entities, but rather key mem-\nbers of the society in which we live, so we have a big responsibility to \ncontribute to its development and well-being. This is even more true \nfor a company with the characteristics of ours, which is so diverse, with \nmany nationalities and operating in dozens of locations throughout \nErnesto Antolin\nChairman of Grupo Antolin\n26 countries; many in small towns where we are the leading employer. \nWith this conviction, the objectives seek to generate value in three \nmain areas \u2013Planet, People and Business\u2013 through specific and tangi-\nble initiatives, which have been being developed for years, but which \nwill now gain new momentum and strength. The framework for action \nfor all of this is the 2030 Agenda, its associated objectives and goals, \nand the 10 Principles of the Global Compact to which we have been \nfully committed since 2004.\n \n\t\u276fThe automotive industry is facing a particularly challenging \nsituation due to the demands arising from a new way of \nunderstanding mobility. How is Grupo Antolin responding to this \nenormous challenge?\nFirst of all, what we are certain about is that the vehicle will continue \nto be the main element in the new mobility, as it has been for more \nthan a century, but it will be a completely transformed vehicle that \nis more focused on people and their real needs. A vehicle that will \noffer services and features never seen before that will make it a more \nimportant space in our daily lives. Connectivity, digitalization and sus-\ntainability are the key elements of that transformation.

We \nare increasingly aware of the need to grow our re-\nsponsibility to the community, and the actions we \ntake to promote sustainable and inclusive develop-\nment must meet the expectations of our stakehold-\ners.\nThe economic and cultural evolution of modern so-\nciety requires businesses that operate on the mar-\nket to act not only as economic operators, but as \na social institution. It is a new dimension, one that \nrequires businesses to shoulder responsibility and \ndrives us towards new horizons and increasingly \nambitious targets.

These \ncustomers expect increasingly high levels of sustainability performance and we are determined to anticipate \nand exceed their expectations as we drive growth.\nThis is not a superficial document. We have taken the time to engage with our stakeholders and understand \ntheir perspectives on sustainability and our impact. This report demonstrates our commitment to a journey \nof sustainability, and our determination to continuously improve our performance over time, reinforced \nby our decision to present 2021 data where possible to provide context for our 2022 performance.\nAmong all our stakeholders and as a company, safety is the first priority for Abraj where consistent \ntraining, systems and support from management and staff have seen continued performance.\nOur contribution to Oman, in line with Oman Vision 2040, is reinforced through the in-country \nvalue (\u2018ICV\u2019) created through our activities and our high levels of workforce Omanisation,  \nis significant.\nAn important focus for us as a Board is the company\u2019s long-term plans.

Within Abraj we use the term Estidama, the Arabic word for \nsustainability, which captures the spirit of our commitment. Oman has a long \ntradition of including sustainability in our culture and we are proud to bring that \ninto our work.\nAs a part of the oil and gas industry we know that our drilling and well services \nactivities can have a significant impact on both the environment and Oman\u2019s economy. \nThat is why, in partnership with our customers, we operate in a responsible manner, \nminimising our impact on the environment whilst achieving positive social outcomes and \nshareholder returns.\nThis report provides an overview of our sustainability efforts, including our achievements and \nareas for improvement.

In its \nearly days, ESG management was \nviewed as being \u2018nice to have\u2019 \nand was generally a separate step \nin the investment process. Now, \nintegrating ESG is an important part \nof fundamental analysis and viewed \nas something we need to consider \nwhen making investment decisions. \nWith the increased focus by the \ninvestment industry on companies\u2019 \nsocial licence to operate, we too \nhave evolved our approach to ESG-\nfocused engagement. With that \nin mind, in 2020 we established a \ndedicated team, welcoming Jessica \nCairns as the ESG and Sustainability \nManager and Moana Nottage as the \nESG and Sustainability Analyst. The \nteam has already made a significant \nimpact by clarifying and tightening \nsome of our internal processes, \nestablishing an enhanced ESG risk \nmanagement framework, replacing \nexternal research into sustainability \nand, of course, putting together this \nESG and Sustainability Report.\nCompany engagement \nAlthough ESG engagement has \nalways been a focus for the \ninvestment team, this year we \nincreased our efforts to identify and \ncomplete specific engagements \nrelated to ESG issues and \nopportunities. \nWe conducted 76 company \nmeetings in which ESG was the \nprimary focus. These engagements \nare increasingly being held with \nthe sustainability specialists of the \ninvestee company so we can discuss \nspecific topics in detail. \nWe have also noticed a pleasing \nincrease in the number of companies \nthat are reaching out to us for our \ninput into their own approach to \nESG management and disclosure \nand to seek advice on improvements \nto t", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

Fifteen \nyears of expansion and leadership, regardless the context around us. We manage over \u20ac1.5b \nin assets and we operate across 4 European offices, with Paris and Munich launched mid-\npandemic. Ambienta\u2019s team is rapidly growing, now strong of 57 resources with more to come.\nOur Private Equity portfolio once again proves that true sustainability equals resilience. In 2021, \nwith Covid, our companies experienced 12% revenues growth against 2019, pre-pandemic \nlevels, and 14% EBITDA growth. No life was lost to Covid among our companies\u2019 68 sites with \nover 3.500 employees and business in 148 countries. 2021 was an opportunity for origination; \nwe completed three new platform investments \u2011 Caprari, Collingwood and Cap Vert \u2011 and five \nadd-on acquisitions. \nAmbienta X, our 2020 Public Market division, first to apply quantitative sustainability \nmethodologies in public equity, as we were first to do so in the buyout world, expanded and \nlaunched three new strategies based on environmental trends: two long only and one low \nvolatility. The division is already among the largest true sustainability HFs in the world and is \nabout to be distributed worldwide. \nSince 2007, the year we started-up, we saw several global crises, but we remained true to our \nconviction that environmental mega trends are the greatest long-term change in the history \nof the world economy. Now again, we are facing a storm of volatility and complexity: the \npandemic still rages on in some areas, supply chains are disrupted, inflation is exploding, a war \nin Europe, skyrocketing energy prices and the urgency of strategic independence. Confronted \nwith these raising challenges the world still found drive and determination to move towards \nsustainability with new regulatory requirements and a renewed attention to decarbonization. \nThere is full convergence with our historic vision that environmental sustainability and ESG \nmanagement are fundamental levers for value creation and a baseline of resilience against \nmarket volatility. \nOur vision has proven itself time and time again; our implementation has always aimed at \ngrowing our business responsibly: values such as transparency, diversity, meritocracy, and \ncollaboration have supported us towards reaching extraordinary results.  As always, also \nin the face of this latest crisis, we have acted responsibly disengaging immediately from all \nportfolio activities in Russia and Belarus.\nOur coherence speaks louder than words. We are B-Corp certified since 2019 and Carbon \nNeutral since 2020. In 2021 we continued our extensive engagement on ESG matters across \nthe asset management industry. All recent product launches are and will be classified as Art. \n9 under the SFDR. PRI has awarded us their top score since 2017.\nIn 2022, our fifteenth anniversary, we will continue our growth. We will be first movers again \nby bringing our environmental insight, and quantitative methodologies, in the world of Private \nCredit: our third strategy after private and public equity. We will also raise our fourth Private \nEquity fund, of course classified as Art. 9 under the SFDR, and further expand Ambienta X \nwith global distribution.\nWe look forward to a new successful year!\nNino Tronchetti Provera\nMessage from our Managing Partner and Founder\nSince 2007 we invest in the most mega of all megatrends\n4\n\nWhile markets continue to challenge our private and public portfolios, true sustainability \nkeeps proving a synonym for resilient businesses. In 2021, despite Covid and supply chain \ndisruptions, our Ambienta II EBITDA grew from \u20ac55.6m in 2020 to \u20ac65.4m and Ambienta III \nfrom \u20ac96.8m to \u20ac111.6m.

Whether it\u2019s using more recycled materials in our products, \nor transitioning our supply chain to 100 percent clean energy, there \nis no part of Apple this work does not reach.\nThis year\u2019s Environmental Progress Report shows the breadth of the environmental \nsolutions we\u2019re advancing, and the scale of collaboration that helped make them \npossible. The details here matter, because they add up to meaningful, substantive \nprogress in our work for the planet. We are laser-focused on our commitment to \nachieve carbon neutrality for our entire footprint by 2030, a goal we have already \nreached for our own operations. At the same time, we\u2019re working to one day make \nour products without taking from the earth, and to be a force for equity in the world \naround us.\nAcross all of these efforts, we never lose sight of our primary mission \u2014 working \nto address the climate crisis. It\u2019s an urgent challenge no one company, entity or \nindividual can tackle alone, and this year, we\u2019re addressing it with more ambition than \never before. In fact, we\u2019ve begun to decouple business growth from emissions as we \ndrive towards our goal of bringing our entire carbon footprint to net zero by 2030 \u2014 \nincluding our supply chain and the use of our products. While our revenue grew  \n33 percent, our net emissions remained flat. \nToday, 213 of our suppliers \u2014 representing the majority of Apple\u2019s direct supplier \nspend \u2014 are committed to using 100 percent renewable energy for their Apple \nbusiness. In\u00a0the last year, we more than doubled the amount of clean energy used to \nmanufacture Apple products.\nWe\u2019re also making great strides toward our goal of one day making our products \nwithout mining. In fiscal year 2021, nearly 20 percent of the materials we shipped in \nApple products came from recycled sources. We\u2019ve more than doubled our use of \nrecycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt. And initiatives like our Apple Trade \nIn program, and advancements in recycling technology, continue to reduce our impact \non the planet by using yesterday\u2019s products to help build tomorrow\u2019s.\nReflections\nIntroduction    Climate Change    Resources    Smarter Chemistry    Engagement    Appendix\n2022 Environmental Progress Report  3\n\nWe also know that a greener future must be a more equitable one. It\u2019s why we \ncontinue to advance our Impact Accelerator, which invests in a diverse class of \nentrepreneurs developing next generation innovations in green technologies. That \nincludes leaders like Karl Johnson, whose company develops environmentally-friendly \nadhesives that make it easier to repair and recycle new technologies, or Betty Manetta \nwhose company has pioneered an AI-based, real-time data collection process to \nassess energy consumption for its users.\nEquity also drives the mission of our Power for Impact initiative, which we launched to \nhelp connect underserved communities with clean, renewable energy. In communities \nfrom South Africa to the Philippines, from Thailand to Israel, we\u2019ve helped bring solar \nand wind energy to schools, hospitals, and rural communities.\nAnd, working with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, our Restore Fund \ninvests to develop working forests \u2014 which support local economic opportunity while \nsequestering carbon from the atmosphere.\nAt Apple, we believe in making bold commitments to improve the world around us \u2014 \nand taking bold steps to meet them.

So we set an even more ambitious \ngoal \u2014 to make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire \nsupply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers\u2019 devices. \nTeams across Apple quickly got to work, and thanks to their innovations, \nwe\u2019ve made extraordinary progress.\nIn this year\u2019s report, you\u2019ll find the most detailed portrait yet of where we \nare today and where we\u2019re headed. Here\u2019s the big picture: Since 2015, \nwe\u2019ve reduced our emissions by over 45 percent. We did it while reaching \nmore Apple users than ever before. And, in doing so, we demonstrated \nthat the choice between a thriving business and a thriving planet is a \nfalse one.\nThis was also the year we called on our suppliers to accelerate their \nwork to address their emissions. We\u2019ve sent a clear message that the \ncompanies who manufacture our products must decarbonize their entire \nApple footprint by 2030, including the use of 100 percent renewable \nelectricity. And today, over 250 of our suppliers \u2014 accounting for over \n85 percent of Apple\u2019s direct manufacturing spend \u2014 are a part of our \nSupplier Clean Energy Program.\nWe share our progress \u2014 and our goals \u2014 because transparency and \naccountability are two sides of the same coin. We do the work and we \nshow our work, because we want to be the ripple in the pond that creates \na broader change.\nThis year, we\u2019ve also made it easier to understand the carbon impact of \nyour Apple devices, and the extraordinary steps we\u2019re taking to reduce \ntheir emissions. In our Product Environment Reports, you can learn about \nrecycled gold in your iPhone, the energy demands of your iPad, and the \npackaging around your Mac. We\u2019re transforming so many aspects of the \nway we make our technology, and with our Product Environment Reports, \nyou\u2019ll see where we\u2019ve made progress and where the hard work remains.\nOne thing is clear: We\u2019re closer than ever to the day you can hold your \nApple device and be confident in the knowledge that it has net-zero \ncarbon impact. There are few companies that can make that claim \u2014 let \nalone ones that set our high standards and transparently show their \nprogress along the way.\nAs we move closer to our goals, we\u2019ve continued to push the pace by \nbringing new clean energy online to power our supply chain. And we\u2019re \ninvesting in a growing number of renewable energy projects to balance \nthe electricity our customers use to charge their devices.\nRecycled materials are also a key focus of our innovations, and another \nway we\u2019re driving down our emissions. Today, about 20 percent of the \nmaterials in our products are from recycled or renewable sources. Our \ngoal is to one day reach 100 percent, and to end our reliance on mining \naltogether.

The report should  \nbe read in conjunction with our Framework for Sustainable Finance.\nIn the year to 31 March 2020, we invested over \u00a3198 million and built more  \nthan 1,000 homes, providing almost 3,000 people with access to new  \naffordable housing. Our development programme is focused on building  \nnew homes with a range of housing options, whilst maintaining a strong  \nprogramme of affordable rented homes as well as supporting housing  \ndevelopment in rural communities.\nWe also partnered with East Boro Housing Trust, (East Boro) and  \nwere delighted to welcome over 150 new colleagues to the Group  \non 31 March 2020. Social impact is a key priority in the delivery  \nof our growth strategy. Growth supports our commitment to  \ndo things in an ethical way, and we consider a range of  \noptions to work in partnerships to enhance our social  \nimpact in our communities.\nIntroduction\nEnvironmental,  \nSocial & Governance  \n(ESG) Report\n2019 / 2020\n\nWe made significant investments in our homes, going above and beyond compliance \nand investing \u00a362.8 million maintaining and improving our existing properties and  \n\u00a39.2 million on a range of health and fire safety measures. We make the best use of  \nour assets by improving the quality of shared communal areas and investing in the \nestates in which they live to help create communities that people are proud of.  \nWe maximise the use of our land to deliver more homes and community facilities. \nWithin our communities we aim to make a positive contribution towards a net \ncarbon reduction, improve the energy efficiency of our stock and limit the  \nimpact on the environment.\nThis year also saw us continue to work towards every one of our homes \nreceiving an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating of  \u2018C\u2019 or above  \nby 2025, five years ahead of the Government target, and through the Warm \nHomes fund we are pleased to have been able to reduce the impact of fuel \npoverty for 81% of customers involved in the scheme.\nListening and responding to the opinions of customers and the feedback \nfrom over 4,000 customers in our latest full customer survey, has \nplayed an important part in shaping decisions that we have made this \nyear and has resulted in a number of services being enhanced and \nimproved. Through the Aster Foundation we continue to empower our \ncustomers to sustain their tenancies and improve their life chances, \nenabling their independence, creating a lasting legacy through our \nthriving communities and sustaining the workforce of the future. It \nalso looks to develop innovative ways to create environmentally \nactive partnerships and embed our sustainability approach \nacross our communities - targeting our investment at the  \nplaces we can make the most impact, will help deliver social \nvalue to our customers.\nThroughout 2019 and 2020, we continued to evolve our \ndigital offer to make it as easy as possible for customers to \naccess the information they need when they need it. And \nwith almost 12,000 customers registered for MyAster, an \ninteractive self-service app that allows customers to \nbook repairs and manage their data, we\u2019re looking at \nmore ways to provide instant access to the things \nthat matter to our customers. \nMore information can be found on our websi", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

We seek to work \ncollaboratively with our portfolio company management teams to embed ESG & \nSustainability principles and goals in their business strategies and operations and \nmonitor performance to ensure that progress is being made. Our annual ESG & \nSustainability report is one of the principal ways in which we seek to communicate \nto our stakeholders on the progress that has been made across a number of ESG \ninitiatives both at TDR and our portfolio. \nThe last twelve months have brought new challenges in Europe as the impact of \nthe pandemic largely subsided to be rapidly replaced by supply chain constraints, \ninflationary and interest rate pressures and a cost of living crisis for many consumers. \nThe environment has meant that our businesses have needed to remain nimble \nand innovative in order to mitigate the financial impacts of these challenges while \nimportantly, needing to focus on supporting their employees, customers and the \ncommunities in which they operate in an attempt to alleviate some of the more \nacute pressures on household budgets. \nSeparately, we have continued to focus on climate change, working on further \nunderstanding the risks and opportunities within our portfolio companies, building \non the groundwork undertaken with a  specialist climate change consultancy \nlast year. We have also worked closely with our portfolio companies to help them \nadd ESG & Sustainability talent including at the most senior level. For the first time, \nwe are happy to report that all our portfolio companies have a dedicated Head \nof ESG & Sustainability in place which should help ensure even greater focus and \nprogress in the future. \nOne of the key areas of focus in our industry at the moment is ensuring reliable and \nconsistent ESG data collection. We have recently rolled out the Worldfavor reporting \nplatform to all of our portfolio companies which we believe will further improve the \ncollection and analysis of ESG data. Furthermore, we believe we can leverage our \nin-house data science expertise to analyse the complex data that we will now be \nable to systematically collect and use this analysis to drive positive ESG outcomes. \nFinally, we continue to encourage equality, diversity and inclusion (ED&I) initiatives \nacross the portfolio and our own activities as well as supporting a number of \nindustry-wide initiatives to improve diversity in the investment industry. We firmly \nbelieve that diversity of perspective leads to better decision-making and are \npleased to have made significant progress in recent years on improving gender \ndiversity within the TDR team such that 50% of the investment team below Partner \nlevel is now female.\nThis report provides more insights into these and many more initiatives across our \nportfolio and at TDR to drive our ESG & Sustainability efforts. Whilst there is good \nprogress, we recognise there is still further work to do. Our focus areas for the \ncoming year include extending the coverage of carbon reporting and working \nwith portfolio companies to set carbon reduction targets, the ongoing promotion \nof inclusive working practices across the portfolio and our own activities, whilst \ncontinuing to provide firm-level support to a range of industry and charitable \ninitiatives.  \nWe hope you enjoy reading our 2021/2022 ESG & Sustainability report.\nThe TDR Partners\nWELCOME\nWelcome\nCONTENTS\nWELCOME\n01-02\nWHO WE ARE\n03-08\nESG AT TDR\n09-10\nENVIRONMENT\n11-20\nSOCIAL\n21-28\nGOVERNANCE\n29-36\n\n3\u2003  \u2003 \u2003 ESG & Sustainability Report 2021/22\n\u2003 \u2003 \u2003 \u2003 4\nSince our establishment in 2002, TDR \nCapital has focused on acquiring \nmajority stakes in market-leading \nEuropean companies with potential \nfor robust growth and resilience \nthrough economic cycles.

But the same conditions \nthat rocked our industry also highlighted our \nresponsibility to our people, our clients and our \ncommunity. In challenge, we found opportunities  \nto serve, to innovate, to:\nLive our values. For years, in speaking to clients, \nprospects, the press and our own people, we\u2019ve \ncalled out our BCD culture as a true differentiator. \nThe events of 2020 put that culture on shining \ndisplay, as we rose to meet challenge after challenge. \nWe\u2019ve never been prouder of our employees\u2019 \ncourage, willingness to serve and grace under \npressure\u2014and now, more than ever, these qualities \nremain crucial.

Our sales and retention \nlevels are far more than numbers on a page. They \nrepresent the deep trust our clients have both in \nour financial stability and our ability to deliver.

Global summits like \nCOP26 are also setting a clearer pathway to reduce the \nimpact of climate change \u2013 and clarifying the role that \nBCD and others in our industry play in this effort. \nAcross industries, our clients have called for more \nactive contributions from their supplier partners to \ntheir commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, \nenvironmental impact, carbon reduction and business \nethics. The strong foundations that BCD has laid across \nour six sustainability Focus Areas meant that we were \nmore than ready for these greater expectations. \nAs we grow, we have an obligation to ourselves, our \nclients and our communities to do so sustainably. We\u2019ve \nconsistently demonstrated our commitment through our \nalignment with the UN Global Compact and Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, the Global Reporting Initiative and \nISO 26000. In 2020, we became the first global travel \nmanagement company to join the Science Based Targets \nInitiative (SBTi). \nFor the second year in a row  \nwe earned a Platinum rating  \nfrom EcoVadis, the world\u2019s largest \nand most trusted provider of \nindependent sustainability ratings. \nThe Platinum rating confirms our outstanding \nsustainability performance, validated best practices, and \nprovides transparency and risk mitigation. It also places \nBCD in the top 1% of the 90,000+ companies currently \nassessed by EcoVadis. \nBuilding sustainable travel programs \nIn a survey of 101 travel buyers conducted in November \nby BCD\u2019s Research & Intelligence team, almost 70% \nreported an increased interest in sustainability from their \ncompany\u2019s senior leadership. In 2021, we continued to \ndevelop solutions to enable clients to better integrate \nsustainable best practices into their travel programs, \nusing innovative practices so that they meet their \nsustainability targets.  \nFor many clients, environmental concerns remain firmly \ntop of mind. From achieving ISO certification for Advito\u2019s \nproprietary carbon emissions methodology initially \npiloted in 2020, to launching a new practice designed to \nhelp customers take advantage of high-speed rail, we\u2019re \nhelping them optimize spend, reduce carbon emissions, \nand increase traveler productivity and satisfaction. At \nthe same time, we\u2019re focused on encouraging companies \nto think more broadly \u2013 and helping them expand their \ntravel program sustainability conversation to include \nsocial and governance aspects. We remain committed \nto being at the forefront of what a sustainable travel \nprogram looks like for our clients.  \nLetter from our Executives\nThe uncertainty the world faced in 2020 rolled into 2021, \nas COVID-19 continued to affect nations, businesses and \nindividuals alike. Being a business travel stakeholder \nin 2021 required clear-eyed realism, as we watched \nrestrictions on travel loosen, tighten and loosen again \nin countries around the world. But we leaned into our \ninnate capacity resilience, taking the challenges we \u2013  \nand our clients \u2013 faced as an extraordinary opportunity \nfor evolution and an unprecedented chance to drive \nsustainable change.  \nIn 2021, we focused on exceeding rapidly shifting \nexpectations for sustainability within newly vulnerable \nglobal supply chains.

As a leader in the intersection of media and \nentertainment, with an element of igaming, we reach \nmillions of sports fans. With this position comes an obli-\ngation to ensure a responsible and sustainable offering \nincluding editorial guidelines, proper segmentation, and \nsafer gambling resources. \nOffering transparency in the \nindustry \nAs we are continually growing our business and adding \nnew entities, we dedicate our attention to initiatives that \nallow us to grow sustainably. Most importantly, we want \nto help sports fans navigate the world of sports betting \nby having them visit a Better Collective brand before \nregistering an account or placing a bet with a sports-\nbook. This is important as we only work with licensed \nsportsbooks in regulated markets. Our US leading sports \nbetting media; Action Network, has an app which is used \nby millions of sports fans. In this app, we have developed \nBetSync, which offers users the unique opportunity to \ntrack their bets and outcomes across several sports-\nbooks. This adds transparency and supports a sustaina-\nble betting behavior. We are excited about the positive \nfeedback we receive from BetSync users and the trans-\nparency we can offer down the line as we onboard more \nsportsbooks to the solution and explore more geogra-\nphies for the app. \nPlaying a key role in \nchannelization \nAs we operate in regulated markets with licensed \nsportsbooks, we play an important role in channeling us-\ners to the right sportsbooks. In the online marketplace, \nusers will be met with a multitude of offers, some of \nwhich are outside the regulated markets which means \nthat user protection measures may not be in place and \nmarketing practices non-compliant.

We reduced \nour consumption of single use plastics by:\n\t\n\u0084 over 100,000 items throughout our corporate \noffices nationally\n\t\n\u0084 over 1 million from the base building operations \nof our pilot assets, Brookfield Place Perth and \nBrookfield Place Sydney, and\n\t\n\u0084 over 700,000 by encouraging our Brookfield \nPlace Perth retail tenants to join us on the \njourney.\nThis is just the beginning. In 2022, we will roll out \nthe initiative to our entire Australian portfolio. \nAs the world searched for better ways to connect \nduring COVID-19, we launched our bespoke tenant \napp, axiis in Australia. This helped us build stronger, \nlonger-term connections with the people who \noccupy our office towers and mixed-use precincts. \naxiis allowed us to remain connected with our \ntenants during lockdowns across the country and \nallowed our placemaking to shift to  \nan always on environment. \nOur return-to-office strategies supported our \nretailers and offered promotions and giveaways \nto the people who work in our buildings to drive \nactivity in CBDs and encourage both a safe and \nengaging return to office. \nIn 2021, we also began the development of \nour inaugural Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan \n(RAP). The development of this RAP is an essential \nstep for our business as we look to extend our \nengagement with First Nations Peoples. We are \nstrongly committed to a future that is enriched and \nemboldened through a culture of reconciliation \nand inclusivity. Our reconciliation journey to date \nhas been one of discovery and engagement; a \nprocess of listening and learning.

It was a declaration of our commitment to \nuse our talents, technology, and resources to drive real change in the energy \nindustry and the world.  \nWe view environmental, social, and governance (ESG) as a key lever to \ntransform the performance of our company and our industry. Over the last \nyear we enhanced our programs and commitments, and have increased the \ntransparency of our reporting.\nThe dual challenge of energy and climate\nThe collective action of people and industry, when directed with purpose, can \nenable change on a global scale. The dual challenge of energy access and \nclimate change is one of the greatest issues facing our world. That is why \nBaker Hughes has committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions from our \noperations by 2050, and develop new solutions to help the oil and gas industry \nreduce carbon emissions across the entire value chain.\nThrough year-end 2019 our Scope 1 and 2 carbon equivalent emissions are \n31 percent lower than our 2012 baseline. Emissions increased slightly over \nthe prior year primarily driven by an increase in activity and expanding the \nboundary of what is reported in our Scope 1 emissions. However, most of \nthese increases were mitigated through energy efficiency improvements \nand emissions reduction projects around the globe; from facility upgrades, to \nrenewable energy projects, to logistics improvements. We will continue to take \naggressive actions that will support us on our journey to net zero.\nLeading with technology\nOur commitment to innovation has led to many high efficiency product and \nservice offerings that are helping customers reduce emissions in the field today. \nWe are investing in new technologies, products, and services that advance \n4\nBaker Hughes 2019 Report on Corporate Responsibility\nLetters from leadership\nDashboard\nCorporate responsibility framework\nPlanet\nPeople\nPrinciples\nIndex and data\n\nour industry in cleaner energy, from carbon capture and storage to hydrogen-\nfueled turbines that will help the industry continue to innovate toward a net \nzero future.

It is becoming increasingly clear, all over the world, that we \nmust act now to preserve the foundations of our livelihoods.\nAs an internationally operating business in the energy, agriculture \nand building materials industries, BayWa is affected by climate \nchange in many ways. That is why we want to make a particular \nimpact through our actions \u2013 true to the title of this year\u2019s Sustain\u00ad\nability Report. Last year we took a close look at the effects of our \nbusiness and adjusted our key fields of action in view of the United \nNations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals. Climate protection \nremains a key focal point. But we also want to make our supply \nchains more sustainable and raise awareness of diversity and \nbroaden knowledge of sustainability throughout our company.\nOur climate strategy, which we resolved in 2018 with the aim of \nensuring that we are carbon-neutral by 2030, is already having a \nsignificant effect. In order to achieve our aim, this year we commit\u00ad\nted to covering our entire electricity supply through renewable \nsources Group-wide by the end of 2020. The issue of sustainability \nis also becoming increasingly important on the stock market, too. \nOne example of this was the significant oversubscription of our \ngreen bond issued in mid-June 2019. This shows that investors \nview BayWa as a solid and attractive investment and trust the com\u00ad\npany to continue the BayWa r.e. success story.\n \nWe also want to make an impact when it comes to diversity. As an \ninternational company, we know that diversity in gender, beliefs, \nage and background has a positive effect on the corporate culture \nand opens the door to more creative solutions and better results \u2013 \nand this too is a contribution to sustainability. In 2019, we signed \nthe Diversity Charter and committed to promoting and embracing \ndiversity throughout the company.\nThis report shows how we were able to make an impact for more \nsustainability in the previous year. It draws on management con\u00ad\ncepts to show how we act and details performance indicators to \ndemonstrate what specific effects our actions are having. We are \nconvinced that one of the ways a company can express its reliabil\u00ad\nity is through transparency, whether it be to employees, custom\u00ad\ners, partners, society or policymakers.\nI would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication to \nsustainability, day in, day out, which makes an impact at many levels \nof the company. And I would also like to call on all of our partners, \ncustomers and suppliers to join us in making sustainability a reality.\nBest regards,\n\nProf. Klaus Josef Lutz\nChief Executive Officer of BayWa AG\nForeword des Vorstand\nProf. Klaus Josef Lutz\nChief Executive Officer of BayWa AG\nIntroduction\nBayWa AG\u2003 Sustainability Report 2019\n03\nIntroduction\u2003 Foreword\n\nMarket\nStrategy and  \nGovernance\nContents\nEnvironment  \nand Climate\nEmployees\nQuality of Life\nAppendix\nIntroduction\nWith its sixth Sustainability Report, BayWa gives an account of \nhow it puts its corporate responsibility into practice.

Our Workplace Giving \nProgram, which allows employees to donate a portion of their \nweekly pre-tax income to a charity of their choice, has contributed \nover $6 million to charitable organisations since its inception.  \nOur Participation Rate is at 36% of employees during Period 13 \nFY22, up from 27% during Period 13 FY21.\nAt Collins Foods, we consider our people our greatest asset.  \nWith over 17,000 employees, we are dedicated to creating a strong \nculture of empowered reporting, safety and belonging. With \ndomestic violence rates continuing to rise across the country, \nCollins Foods has worked with external specialists to create an \nawareness and support program for employees who may be \naffected. The program includes up to $5,000 of financial support \nand five days of paid leave as circumstances may require.\nWe also strive to provide safe and healthy workplaces across all \nbrands and restaurant support centres and invest in a range of \ninitiatives that support our people, focusing on inclusion, diversity, \nreward and recognition, and training. To continue growing our \nculture of acceptance and belonging, our Diversity and Inclusion \nCouncil established four working groups \u2014 LGBTQI+, Disability, \nMulticultural, and Equality \u2014 each tasked with delivering an \noverarching roadmap for the enhancement of diversity and \ninclusion initiatives across Collins Foods, to strengthen our  \nculture of belonging.\nPlanet\nWe acknowledge the importance of having a role in tackling climate \nchange and pollution. To play our part, Collins Foods has become \nthe only quick service restaurant (QSR) company in Australia to \ncommit to installing solar panels in every possible free-standing \ndrive-thru restaurant. During the year, we installed 89 additional \nsolar panel-based energy systems to 89 drive-thru restaurants. \nGovernance\nWe cannot deliver on our ESG goals without proper governance \nin place. At Collins Foods, we have high standards of corporate \ngovernance, recognising that good governance not only protects \nand enhances stakeholder interests but is important to our  \nongoing success. \nDuring the year, the Collins Foods Board updated the Audit and \nRisk Committee Charter to include sustainability as a Committee \nresponsibility. \nAs an ASX-listed corporation, we respect and support the integrity \nof the market where investors trade in Collins Foods\u2019 shares  \n(ASX: CKF) and from which we access capital.

ESG\u2019s relevance \nfor business and investors is well understood. However, \ngovernments haven\u2019t caught up. Federal, provincial/territorial \nand municipal governments in Canada need to understand  \nwhy ESG is relevant to them and how they should respond.\nIgnoring these questions is not an option. Increasingly, ESG is a point of differentiation that affects \ncompetitiveness both for jurisdictions and the companies that operate within them. Sustainability \nperformance has become \u201ctable stakes,\u201d and governments that don\u2019t explicitly grapple with these \nissues risk having others dictate how their performance will be assessed. \nA real opportunity exists for governments in Canada at the municipal, provincial and federal \nlevels to support strong and consistent ESG reporting, raise the bar for performance, communicate \nsuccess to different stakeholder audiences, and provide clarity for investors. These actions will \nhelp companies operating in the jurisdiction; they also help the government by building its brand \nand its investmen", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

If it were a country, food waste would \nbe the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. \nWhen combined, HVAC and food waste contribute \nan estimated 25% of annual greenhouse gas \nemissions. \nCarrier embraces environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) progress through measures \nto improve the planet, people and communities. \nWe play an important role in decarbonizing the \nglobal economy.

{"task": "Quantitative ESG data extraction", "input": "THE PERILS\nOF DEEP-SEA MINING\na briefing for financial institutions\n\n2\nOverview     \nThis briefing for financial institutions (FIs) provides an overview of the nascent industry of deep-sea \nmining (DSM) and the related environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks that it poses. It also \nprovides several actionable recommendations that will allow FIs to avoid exposure to these risks.\nKey findings:\n\u25cf\t The latest scientific research indicates that the environmental damage caused by DSM is \nlikely to be extensive, irreversible and unmitigable.1 DSM risks disrupting the global carbon \ncycle, threatens fisheries and food security, and would lead to irreparable biodiversity loss \nwith devastating consequences for both people and planet.2\n\u25cf\t Biodiversity must be placed at the core of FIs\u2019 ESG strategies; the likelihood of future \ndisclosure requirements on biodiversity is an important risk for FIs to consider given the \ninevitable biodiversity loss that would be caused by DSM. \n\u25cf\t FI involvement with the DSM industry is at odds with compliance with the International \nFinance Corporation\u2019s Performance Standard 63 on biodiversity conservation and the \nsustainable management of living natural resources, due to its adverse impacts on \u201ccritical \nhabitats\u201d of significant importance to (Critically) Endangered and/or endemic/restricted-\nrange species.\n\u25cf\t The future financial viability of DSM is highly uncertain owing to the unpredictable nature \nof future demand for seafloor metals, considerable litigation risk, and the technology being \nlargely unproven at operational commercial scale. Consequently, any financial involvement \nwith the DSM industry by FIs should be considered extremely high risk.\n\u25cf\t DSM\u2019s largest corporate backer, Lockheed Martin, exited the industry in March 2023 following \nthe sale of its UK Seabed Resources subsidiary to Loke Marine Minerals, a Norwegian startup \n\u2013 evidence of major corporations\u2019 increasing reluctance to invest in the DSM industry.4 \nShipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk is the latest major name to divest itself of interests in \nthe deep-sea mining industry, with the sale of its stake in leading DSM proponent, The Metals \nCompany (TMC).5\n\u25cf\t An increasing number of nations are opposing DSM or calling for a precautionary pause or \nmoratorium, including (as of April 2023) Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, \nFederated States of Micronesia, Fiji, France, Germany, New Zealand, Palau, Panama, Samoa, \nSpain, and Vanuatu.6\n\u25cf\t Major companies including BMW, Google, Philips, Renault, Samsung and Volkswagen have \nsigned a statement supporting a moratorium on DSM and pledging to keep DSM minerals out \nof their supply chains.7\n\u25cf\t The growing global movement against DSM, and the industry\u2019s lack of social legitimacy, \npresents a potentially severe reputational risk for FIs who provide support to it. This risk is \nhighly likely to intensify in years to come as public awareness grows of the irreparable and \nfar-reaching environmental impacts of DSM.\n\u00a9 MARUM\nCover image: NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration.\n\n3\nRecommendations to Financial Institutions\nEJF recommends that FIs:\n\u25cf\t\nAdopt and publish policies which explicitly exclude the provision of banking or other financial \nservices8 to:\no\t\nDSM companies, or companies who have a significant share of their revenue or \nactivities within DSM; and\no\t\ncompanies who have subsidiaries (or divisions of the same company) engaged in \nDSM within the corporate group.\n\u25cf\t\nEngage with non-mining companies9 who are potential users of DSM metals to encourage them \nnot to provide support for the industry by: (i) supporting calls for a global moratorium on DSM \nactivities10; (ii) monitoring and tracking where they source minerals for their business; and (iii) \nexcluding minerals/metals obtained from DSM from their supply chains.\n\u25cf\t\nEngage with investors and other sources of DSM funding to encourage them not to provide support \nfor the industry, in line with the conclusion of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance \nInitiative (UNEP FI) that there is \u201cno foreseeable way in which the financing of deep-sea mining activities \ncan be viewed as consistent with the Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles.\u201d11\n\u25cf\t\nExtend their ESG strategy to cover biodiversity (the protection and restoration of nature).\nIn order to action the above recommendations, EJF encourages financial institutions to carry out \nsatisfactory due diligence in order to assess their own exposure (both direct and indirect) to the \nfinancing of DSM activities.12\n\u20ac\nDSM and the risks to financial institutions\nDSM\nrisks for\nFIs \n\u2022 physical disturbance\n\u2022 habitat destruction\n\u2022 sediment plumes\n\u2022 noise & light pollution \n\u2022 fisheries impacts\n\u2022 health & food security\n\u2022 exclusion of\n                             impacted groups\n\u2022 unknown carbon\n                      cycle impacts\n\u2022 uncertain regulatory\n     framework\n\u2022 litigation risk\neconomic viability \u2022\nfuture demand \u2022\nDSM timescales \u2022\ngrowing opposit", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

Today, while there is still much more to \ndo, I am pleased to share the meaningful steps we have \ntaken on the journey so far, as we continue to realize our \nbusiness goals and growth. Our ESG pillars \u2013 Respect \nfor Resources, Respect for People & Communities, and \nRespect for Transparency \u2013 are not just the foundational \nstrategy, they are living, breathing processes that hold \nus accountable to fulfill our mission responsibly and \nsustainably.\nFor Digital Edge, ESG has been engrained in our \ncompany\u2019s values since day one. While our company may \nonly be three years old, we are investing in world-class \ntechnology that will create the most efficient data centers \nin the world. Our commitment to energy efficiency, \nethical treatment of our team members and partners, and \ntransparency is in our company DNA. The investments we \nare making will ensure we can live our values \u2013 and meet \nour customers\u2019 needs \u2013 for decades to come. \nThis 2nd ESG report builds on the ambitions we set out \nlast year and outlines the tangible steps we have taken \nor are taking to meet these. We also report for the first \ntime on some key ESG metrics from across our business \nto ensure we can be held accountable for our efforts \nas we continue on this pathway. Below are some major \nmilestones and key highlights from the past twelve \nmonths I would like to draw your attention to: \n\u2022\t Our commitment to our people cannot be overstated. In \n2022, across our construction and operations, we reached \nmore than 2.5 million work hours without lost time injury. \nWe will continue to emphasize the principles of health \nand safety that ensure our people are protected and feel \nsafe in our workplaces. \n\u2022\t We recently opened the doors of our new data center \nin Manila, NARRA1, the largest carrier neutral data center \nin operation in the market. Through this facility Digital \nEdge has become the first colocation operator to deploy \nthe patented StatePoint\u00ae Liquid Cooling technology in \nAsia, which has enabled us to achieve market leading \nPUE of 1.193 or better during the integrated systems \ntesting phase. We hope this facility will set new standards \nfor the region to aspire to when it comes to delivering \nsustainable data centers in hot and humid climates.\n\u2022\t In 2023, we have two facilities - NARRA1 in the \nPhilippines and Edge2 \u2014 on track to achieve LEED Gold \nCertification. There is no clearer demonstration of our \ncommitment to state-of-the-art environmental design \nand build processes than to be awarded this great \nhonor. Going forward, all our new builds will meet, at a \nminimum, LEED Silver standards. \n\u2022\t We are proud to share openly our Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions footprint, beginning our process to manage \nand mitigate our footprint to be carbon neutral by 2030. \nAs a growing company, we know this is an ambitious \nand difficult goal. Having baseline data in Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions ensures we can consistently \nand accurately measure our progress \ngoing forward. \n\u2022\t Digital Edge is dedicated to ensuring our facilities set \nthe strongest possible standards for data security and \nprivacy for our customers and their users. All Digital Edge \nfacilities achieved ISO 27001 standards certification for \ninformation security management systems in April 2023.\nThis is merely a snapshot of the exciting work we are \ndoing to further embed ESG in the Digital Edge way of life. \nWe look forward to your feedback as you read this second \nreport and my door is always open for suggestions and \nideas on what more we can do in the year ahead. While \nwe are still at the beginning of this journey, I am confident \nthat, together, we can put responsibility and sustainability \nat the heart of everything we do and achieve our mission \nto bridge the digital divide. \nSincerely,\nSamuel Lee\nCEO\nCEO Letter\n2\nDigital Edge ESG Report 2023\n\nESG\nReport\n2023\nABOUT DIGITAL EDGE\nDigital Edge is the growth-oriented leader for easy, efficient and \neconomical interconnection across the Asian region.

At COP26 the \nnations of the world agreed to uphold or develop new \ncommitments towards a safer global climate, with much \nwork still to be done. In global financial markets, we see \ncontinued progress towards meeting sustainability and \ndecarbonization goals, but also clear signs that we must \npick up the pace of the clean energy transition globally.\nAt EIP, the monumental events of the past year have \nfurther accelerated our mission to lead the transition to \na sustainable energy future while achieving superior, \nrisk-adjusted returns for our investors. In 2021 we \nmade our first five investments from the Frontier Deep \nDecarbonization Fund, our new fund dedicated to investing \nin companies at the forefront of deep decarbonization \ntechnology. We also launched the Elevate Future Fund, our \nfund dedicated to investing in companies that are led by \npeople from underrepresented groups, empower diverse \ntalent, and/or create economic opportunity for underserved \ncommunities. \nOur portfolio of nearly 100 innovations and technologies, \nwhich we believe are key building blocks of the energy \ntransition, has collectively enabled reductions of the global \ncarbon load by more than six million metric tons in 2021. \nWe also fully offset our own carbon footprint, and our 40+ \ncorporate partners have increased their commitments and \ndedication to the energy transition.\nYet we know that we must do more. In addition to \nexpanding our investment platform, we are intensifying \nour ESG-related work with our portfolio companies and \ninvestors, improving the environmental attributes of our \nown workplace, and collaborating much more with peers \nin our industry to advance better impact and carbon \nreporting practices.

We are committed to doing just that.  \nIn June of this year, we changed our corporate name from Harsco to \nEnviri to better reflect what we do and who we are. The reimagined \nlook is designed to communicate our ongoing work to develop \nand refine creative recycling and beneficial reuse methods that \nprovide customers worldwide with solutions to their most complex \nenvironmental challenges. \nWhile there is always more to accomplish on ESG, I am proud of \nEnviri's contributions to making the world cleaner and greener. \n\n\nOf note, in 2022:\n\u2022\t \u0007100% of our revenue came from Enviri\u2019s environmental \nsolutions divisions (continuing operations)\n\u2022\t \u0007Our divisions recycled or reused more than 35 billion \npounds of waste\n\u2022\t \u000787% of slag waste was recycled/reused by our \nHarsco Environmental division\n\u2022\t \u000790% of waste was recycled/reused by our Clean Earth division\nWe accomplished this by becoming a safer company.

This, \nin addition to being the largest company supporting the world\u2019s steel \nmakers in remediating slag. In 2022, 100% of Enviri\u2019s revenue came \nfrom its environmentally focused segments (Harsco Environmental \nand Clean Earth) compared to 67% in 2016.\nAs Enviri continues to expand its global environmental solutions \nbusiness, its focus remains on: \n\u2022\t \u0007Integrating and capturing the value of combined specialty waste \nmanagement businesses in the United States\n\u2022\t \u0007Growing the portfolio of environmental services to steel and \naluminum mills globally\n\u2022\t \u0007Increasing the number of branded products that use industrial \nbyproducts as the primary raw material\nEnviri\u2019s vision is of a cleaner, greener world.  As such, it strategically \nfocuses on innovative environmental solutions to help bring its vision \nto fruition. Today, most stakeholders, including investors, customers, \nemployees, and communities demand that companies do more to \nenhance the environment, protect human health, reduce waste \ndisposed of in landfills, reduce carbon emissions, and combat climate \nchange.

A key focus during 2021 was \nstandardizing data collection and incident reporting \nacross our operations so we can accurately measure \nperformance and identify opportunities for \nimprovement. Those efforts are reflected in this report, \nwhich includes quantitative data on health and safety \nperformance, energy consumption, GHG emissions and \nwater usage.

All rights reserved\nESG: A new era in practice opportunities\u2002|\u20023\nIntroduction\u00a0\nWhile environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nissues have increasingly been added to organizational \nagendas over the past several years, new and emerging \nreporting mandates and continued pressure from \nstakeholders are making ESG a top priority. At this year\u2019s \nAICPA and CPA.com ESG Symposium\u2014the second \nannual gathering of more than 60 representatives from \ncompanies, firms, standard setters, regulators and \ntechnology providers in the ESG ecosystem\u2014much \nof the discussion focused on the value that CPAs can \ndeliver in this space. \u201cRising market demand for ESG \nservices is providing significant opportunities for the \naccounting profession,\u201d said Erik Asgeirsson, president \nand CEO, CPA.com. \nPurpose-built ESG business services\u2014\nconsulting, implementation, engineering \nand IT services that are chiefly designed  \nto drive sustainability-related outcomes\u2014\nare expected to grow from nearly  \n$38 billion in 2023 to almost $65 billion \nin 2027, according to International Data \nCorporation, which called it \u201cone of  \nthe fastest growing spaces in the  \nbusiness world.\u201d\nThree of the top 100 firms below the Big Four in \nattendance estimated that ESG services would be  \nat-least a $100 million service line.There\u2019s reason to \nbelieve that opportunities in the ESG services arena \ncould have a proportionate impact on smaller firms, as \nwell. This will happen because these small business \nclients are in supply chains to larger companies \nthat must comply with the regulations. They may \nbe expected to meet certain ESG requirements and \nreport certain metrics and progress to remain in the \nsupply chain of these larger companies. Since smaller \nbusinesses don\u2019t have the internal resources necessary \nto meet their larger business partners\u2019 expectations, \nthey may look to their trusted advisors for help.\nAnd while climate change can be a controversial topic \nfor some, it\u2019s undeniable that pending legislation and the \nmarket environment will have an impact on businesses \nthat cannot be ignored. The accounting profession \nis perfectly positioned to provide the measurement, \nreporting and assurance that will enable good decision \nmaking, noted Barry Melancon, CPA, CGMA, AICPA & \nCIMA president & CEO.\u00a0 \nFirms will face hurdles within this space. An intricate \nset of drivers\u2014stakeholders\u2019 expectations as well \nas national, regional and global regulations and \nlegislation\u2014have created complexity. Uncertainty is \nexpected to persist in this complex ecosystem, and it \nmay often be influenced by factors that the profession \ncan\u2019t control, according to Melancon. Useful and \neffective ESG reporting will depend on commonly \naccepted standards, which are beginning to emerge. \n\u201cCPAs have the opportunity to offer data-driven \nsolutions,\u201d he said. \nThe portion of companies globally that report having a long way \nto go to be ready for ESG assurance to meet new regulatory \nrequirements, according to a KPMG survey. \n75%\n\nESG: A new era in practice opportunities\u2002|\u20024\nAn advocacy role\u00a0\nThe AICPA has long called for business reporting that \ngoes beyond financial issues alone, Melancon noted, \nand a global answer makes the best sense. That\u2019s why \nthe profession took on an important advocacy role \nin the development of the International Sustainability \nStandards Board (ISSB), which is supported by the  \nIFRS Foundation. The ISSB has issued the first \ntwo\u202fglobal standards related to sustainability \nreporting. The intent was to create a new system of \nreporting with as much commonality of application \nas possible that could be used around the world. \nStakeholders believe the board has achieved that \ngoal.

This is our first publication on ESG-related topics and represents a \nsignificant milestone for us as a company. Social responsibility and corporate \ngovernance have been pillars of our business since our inception. With the \npublication of this report, we cement our commitment to sustainability, and are \nproud to provide a dedicated space to share our progress and ESG-related \nactivities.\nGlobal demand for semiconductors continues to grow, driven largely by demand \nfor electronics such as smartphones and the proliferation of applications \nincluding the Internet of Things and cloud computing. Continued growth is \nexpected with the enhancements of existing products, the introduction of the 5G \nnetworks and the inclusion of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence \n(AI), as well as rapid growth in automotive, electrical and autonomous vehicles \nand industrial electronics. In the face of such demand and the associated increase \nin environmental and social impact, there is a need for all actors in the industry to \ntake meaningful steps towards sustainability. \nCatmek\u2019s systems inspect semiconductor wafers for defective dies and ensure the \nhigh quality of products used by end-users, thereby reducing the costs, waste, and \ngreenhouse gas emissions associated with replacing defective products. \nThis commitment to environmental sustainability extends to our facilities. Our \nmanufacturing process is non-polluting, and we are constantly investing in efforts \nto reduce our footprint, whether that is through optimization campaigns such as \nour recent switch to LED lightning at our facilities, or the installation of charging \nstations on site so we can transition our fleet to hybrid/electric vehicles.\nIn addition to these efforts, we are also steadfast in our belief in the power of \nhuman connections. We have always believed in fair employment and fostering a \npositive working environment, and employees can now enjoy onsite activities \nsuch as HIIT, pilates, or basketball. At our facilities in Israel, the presence of team \nmembers that are well past retirement age is a testament to the strength of the \nbond we all share. \nThis is also the approach we take with our customers. For us, \u2018customers first\u2019 is \nnot just a slogan, and we back it up with comprehensive training, support and \ncustomer service packages.\nFinally, we have longstanding partnerships with our local communities, in Israel \nand around the world. We donate our time and contribute to the economic \ngrowth of our surroundings. A standout part of these activities is our investment \nin education \u2013 our high school training programs and intensive internships for \nstudents.  We believe that by building the next generation of tech workers within \nthe communities where we operate, we are safeguarding their future, and ours.\nRafi Amit\nCEO\n3\nESG AT CAMTEK\nENVIRONMENT\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\n\nAbout This Report\nThis report represents the first sustainability reporting from Camtek Ltd., a publicly traded company (Symbol: \nCAMT) with securities listed on NASDAQ and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE).

We assume the \nworkforce is generally aware of their current or prospective employer\u2019s ESG performance, either due \nto explicit corporate communications or through an individual\u2019s own research efforts in this area.\nWORKFORCE SENTIMENT\nIn this study, we compared the ESG performance of employers with different workforce \nsentiment. Companies were categorized into three groups: \n\u2022\t Global average employers\n\u2022\t Top employers by employee satisfaction \n\u2022\t Top employers by attractiveness to students and young professionals\nAs illustrated in Exhibit A.1, available data proxies were used to group these companies \naccordingly.  \nEmployer group\nData proxy\nGlobal average employers\nCompanies included in the MSCI ACWI Index\nTop employers by employee satisfaction\nCompanies included in both:\n\u2022\t MSCI ACWI Index\n\u2022\t Fortune\u2019s 2019 \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d\nTop employers by attractiveness to students \nand young professionals\nCompanies included in both:\n\u2022\t MSCI ACWI Index\n\u2022\t Universum\u2019s 2019 \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Attractive Employers\u201d\nExhibit A.1: Selection criteria for each employer group\n\nESG as a Workforce Strategy\n\u00a9 Marsh & McLennan Companies \n3\nESG PERFORMANCE \nThree types of data from the MSCI ESG database (Exhibit A.2) were used to quantify the \nESG performance of companies across the three employer groups and evaluate their ESG \nperformance at different levels of granularity. \nThe data points from levels 1, 2, and 3 in Exhibit A.2 were averaged for each employer group \nand then compared across employer groups. In this way, we evaluated the ESG performance of \nemployers with differing workforce sentiments. \nOverall\n ESG score\nCOMPANY-LEVEL DATA POINT\nDESCRIPTION\nEXAMPLE\nE, S, and G pillar scores\nUnderlying indicators within \neach E, S, and G pillar\nAn overall ESG score of 5.6\nA Governance score of 4.8\n1\n3\nSource: MSCI, Marsh & McLennan Advantage Insights analysis \n2\nRepresents a company\u2019s performance\nin the respective dimensions \nof Environmental, Social, \nand Governance criteria\nRepresents a company\u2019s performance\non a specific issue in the Environmental,\nSocial, or Governance dimension\nThe proportion of female \nboard members \nis 20 percent\nRepresents a company\u2019s overall\naggregate ESG performance\nExhibit A.2: Types of MSCI ESG data points used for sample of employers\n\nESG as a Workforce Strategy\n\u00a9 Marsh & McLennan Companies \n4\nSELECTING OUR ESG AND \nWORKFORCE DATASETS\nIn our analysis, datasets were taken from four sources:\n1. The MSCI ESG database: ESG scores and related data\nThe MSCI ESG database contains ESG scores and related data for more than 7,500 companies \naround the world.\nMSCI measures a company\u2019s ESG performance, in the form of ESG scores and ratings, based \non the MSCI ESG Ratings methodology. This methodology is designed to identify the most \nsignificant environmental, social, and governance risks and opportunities for each industry and \nprovides an overall rating based on companies\u2019 exposure to and management of those risks and \nopportunities. \nMSCI\u2019s overall ESG scores for each company, shown as level 1 in Exhibit A.2, represent the \nindustry-adjusted weighted average of a company\u2019s E, S, and G pillar scores. This industry \nadjustment ensures that a company is evaluated against the standards and performance of its \nindustry peers. The resulting score ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the \nbest; this corresponds to an ESG rating between CCC (worst) and AAA (best). \nMSCI\u2019s E, S, and G pillar scores for each company, represented as level 2 in Exhibit A.2, are \nderived from the weighted average of issue scores, which are calculated based on the results of \nthe underlying ESG indicators.\nData for the underlying indicators within each pillar, shown as level 3 in Exhibit A.2, are \ncomprised of raw data collected by MSCI. We used these underlying indicators to further \nevaluate a company\u2019s performance on specific issues within each pillar, allowing us to analyze \nthe more granular relationship between specific ESG issues and workforce sentiment. Underlying \nESG indicators were selected for analysis based on the following criteria:\n\u2022\t Transparency: An issue for which information is available to current and prospective \nemployees\n\u2022\t Universality: An issue that is applicable across all industries \n\u2022\t Measurability: An issue that is measurable and, therefore, comparable between companies\nAs a result, the following indicators for analysis were chosen (Exhibit A.3):\n\nESG as a Workforce Strategy\n\u00a9 Marsh & McLennan Companies \n5\nEnvironmental\nSocial\nGovernance\nESG indicator\nCarbon emission intensity\nEmploy", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

The most important of these events, \nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine, began suddenly and violently, \nchanging the lives of millions of Ukrainians coming to Poland \nand of the Poles sheltering them. We have been dealing with \nother events for a long time, including the ongoing consequ-\nences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused the COVID-19 \npandemic, the global economic downturn and advancing \nclimate change. All of this means that we constantly have \nto adapt our business to the changes, responding to them \nresponsibly while considering the regulatory framework and \nthe market\u2019s requirements.\nA summary of these efforts in 2022 is provided in this ESG \nreport prepared by our team. The report aims at providing \nyou with an overview of our sustainability efforts and the \nfulfilment of our commitments to the community and the \nenvironment.

We realise that our decisions and \nactions affect the environment in which we operate, so we \ntake responsibility for it at every project stage. All our buil-\ndings are designed and built to the highest environmental \nstandards, as evidenced by their high building certification \nscores.\nIn March 2022, Olivia Centre\u2019s buildings were certified for the \nsecond time with the highest possible WELL Health-Safety \nRating, a data-driven, independently verified assessment of \nbuildings by a certification body, focusing on the analysis of \noperational principles as well as occupancy and maintenan-\nce standards. In addition, in 2022, Olivia Star was awarded \na BREEAM final certificate in the as-built phase, including \ntenant space fit-out (Fully Fitted) with a rating of Excellent.\nLast year we decided to expand our business to the residen-\ntial market and started the construction of the\u00a0 Platynowa \nPark\u00a0housing\u00a0estate in Gda\u0144sk. In turn, Olivia Centre itself will \nbe enriched with new functions \u2013 implemented by the invest-\nments planned here - which confirms our long-standing \nResponsible construction\ndevelopment policy toward a multifunctional space, open to \nresidents and their needs.\nStable business \nand involved community\nWe help develop local businesses and economy by attracting \nfurther investment in the region to create new jobs. We acti-\nvely support the activities of the local community associated \nwith the Oliwa district in which Olivia Centre is located, for \nexample, through the support of modernisation works in the \nneighbourhood, organising activities for children and senior \ncitizens or supporting nearby schools.\nDespite many challenges, at Olivia Centre, in the past year, \nwe achieved record office lease results (92% of leased office \nspace by the end of 2022). We attracted Residents repre-\nsenting new industries that were previously absent from our \npremises. Even though hybrid working has recently become \nmore important, we recorded attendance in our buildings \nwhich is 45% higher than in the previous year and the highe-\nst-ever number of events held at Olivia Centre. None of this \nwould have been possible without the community centred \naround Olivia.\nA particular expression of commitment came just hours after \nthe Russian attack on Ukraine.

And in our view, whatever \nthe entity in question, the characteristics of high \nquality reporting and effective communication with \ninvestors are always broadly the same.\nTherefore we believe that you will find this Guidance \nequally relevant to your organisation whether it is  \na large publicly listed issuer with a long track record  \nof reporting; a smaller company; a privately held \nbusiness; or a debt issuer.\nHow investors use ESG \ninformation is changing\nIn recent years, the views of investors in this area have \nmatured significantly. ESG-related information has \nmoved from a \u2018peripheral\u2019 to a \u2018core\u2019 part of investment \nanalysis, across all asset classes1.\nSignatories to the United Nations-supported Principles \nfor Responsible Investment (PRI) now represent $60trn2 \nin assets under management, up from $22trn2 in 2010. \nAlmost all leading institutional investors of UK and \nItalian listed companies are PRI signatories. Recent \nresearch from the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance \n(GSIA)3 suggests that sustainable investing strategies \nnow represent more than 60% of professionally  \nmanaged assets for EU investors.\nThe need for issuers to respond to this demand for \ninformation is clear. By disclosing the information that \ninvestors want, issuers can provide reassurance that \nthey are effectively managing business risks and \nidentifying opportunities. There is growing evidence \nthat issuers that publish high quality information on \nthe longer-term implications of ESG for their business \nare more likely to attract and retain long-term \ninvestors4. These issuers can also reduce the cost of \ncapital and increase their ability to raise new capital  \nto finance sustainable projects.\nThe process of reflecting on, analysing and reporting \nESG issues provides important insights into the positive \nand negative implications for financial and operational \nperformance. This also applies to decisions about \nstrategy and capital expenditure. Further, having", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

We believe \nthat this will continue to be the case and that the \nGroup\u2019s model, of helping commercialise cutting-\nedge science, is of real importance, and has and will \ncontinue to have a positive impact.\nScientific innovation has proved to be a vital \nweapon in the world\u2019s response to the COVID-19 \npandemic and some of the companies that the \nGroup has backed and supported over the years \nhave played critical roles in this response. This \ncontribution has amplified the importance of \nbacking innovation in science over the long-term. \nThe pandemic has also presented the world with a \nglimpse of what being unprepared for an existential \ncrisis might look like\u2014a stark reminder of our \nfragility\u2014and this has driven increased interest in \ntackling the global threat of climate change.\nWith COP26 in the UK in November, we are acutely \naware of the need to support the energy transition. \nIP Group is well placed to do this as an investor in \nclean technologies but we will also be focusing on \nhow to manage our own environmental impact and \nthat of our portfolio.\nIn recent years we have articulated this strong \nnatural alignment between the Group\u2019s purpose \nand impact by assessing the impact of our portfolio \nagainst the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals \n(\u2018SDGs\u2019) and have also focused on improving our \nperformance on broader ESG issues.\nA particular focus for IP Group has been achieving \ngreater inclusion and diversity, particularly in the \nGroup\u2019s Senior Leadership Team and we have made \ngood progress with 33% female representation on \nthe Board and 36% female representation on our \nnew Executive Committee whose composition has \nbeen designed to ensure a greater level of diversity \nwith the creation of two \u2018Employee Executive\u2019 roles. \nWe believe we are the first FTSE250 company to \nput such a structure in place.\nThere is, of course, much still to do. The current \npandemic has led to terrible loss of life and \nhuman suffering and has also amplified existing \ninequalities in our society, including systemic \nracism, gender inequality, and poverty. We firmly \nbelieve that IP Group has an important role to play \nin the post-pandemic world, which we hope will \nlook very different another 20 years from now. \nAlan Aubrey \nCEO, IP Group\nCONTENTS\nMessage from the CEO\t\n1\nGroup at a Glance\t\n2\nOur Approach to ESG and Responsible \nInvestment\t\n3\n\t\n\u2013 External frameworks and membership \nbodies\t\n3\n\t\n\u2013 Focus areas\t\n4\n\t\n\u2013 ESG management processes\t\n5\n\t\n\u2013 The Ethics Committee\t\n5\nESG at IP Group\t\n6\n\t\n\u2013 Environmental\t\n6\n\t\n\u2013 Social\t\n8\n\t\n\u2013 Employee and Engagement  \nNon-financial KPI\t\n8\n\t\n\u2013 Key areas of progress \t\n9\n\t\n\u2013 Diversity & Inclusion\t\n10\n\t\n\u2013 COVID-19 response\t\n12\n\t\n\u2013 Community Engagement\t\n13\n\t\n\u2013 Governance\t\n14\nIP Group as a responsible investor\t\n15\n\t\n\u2013 Responsible Investment \t\n15\n\t\n\u2013 Embedding ESG into our investment \nprocesses\t\n15\nImpact at IP Group\t\n16\n\t\u2013 How IP Group and its portfolio map against \nthe Sustainable Development Goals\t\n16\n\t\n\u2013 Measuring progress \t\n16\n\t\n\u2013 Case studies \t\n17\nReporting & Transparency: SASB\t\n23\nReporting & Transparency: TCFD\t\n26\nAppendix: Top 20 portfolio companies\t\n27\n1\nIP Group plc\nESG Report 2021\nINTRODUCTION\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGROUP AT A GLANCE\nIP Group\u2019s purpose is to evolve great ideas into \nworld-changing businesses.

We deeply regret these fatalities and loss, \nand we continue to work hard to achieving zero occupational \naccidents, reinforced by the launch of the \u201cPlayitSafe\u201d program.\nFurther, we are also addressing the vulnerability of people and \ncommunities, through contributions to reducing energy poverty \nand investments in access to energy projects, mainly in Africa, \nhaving committed \u20ac22.5M until 2025. \nGovernance\nIn 2021, we also took steps to further streamline our \ngovernance structure, reaching 40% and 38% women \nrepresentation at Executive Board of Directors (EBD) and \nGeneral Supervisory Board levels, respectively, and making \nfurther efforts in the transparency of gender data reporting. \nWe intend to continue leading by example and were pleased \nto once again be recognised by the Bloomberg Gender \nEquality Index 4. EDP also renewed its EBD\u2019 Remuneration \nPolicy, reinforcing ESG metrics on variable components.\nKey Highlights\n2021 saw an unprecedented global movement of net zero \ncommitments by countries, cities, regions, businesses and \ninvestors. While COP26 con\ufb01rmed \"code red for humanity\" \namidst the IPCC1\u2019s starkest assessment ever, it also kept to \nthe objective to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. \nThe energy transition emerged as the greatest challenge of \nour time, with the High-Level Dialogue on Energy (UN HLDE) \nconvened in September by the UN Secretary General. The \nIEA Net Zero Report signaled a very narrow pathway to \nfulfill net zero, combining renewables, electrification and \nenergy efficiency with adequate policies and further \ntechnological innovation. Greater collaboration and action \nare needed from entire ecosystems, across business, supply \nchain, governments and civil society. \nWe revised our business strategy (BP 2021-25) which now \ncomprises ambitious ESG  targets focused on leading the \nenergy transition, protecting the environment, delivering a \npositive impact on society and maintaining strong \ngovernance. \nWe committed \u20ac24 bn of further investment in the energy \ntransition and we are set to become coal free by 2025 (zero \ncontribution of coal to our revenues by 2025 year-end). \nFurthermore, we plan to be \u201cAll Green\u201d(100% renewables in \nour portfolio), and carbon neutral by 2030 (reducing our \nscope 1 and 2 emissions by 98%).\nThis year we continued to work with our partners and \nrelevant business networks, including the UN, UN Global \nCompact, WBCSD, The Climate Group, We Mean Business, \nSEforALL, on collective projects and initiatives to further \nadvance those topics.\nEDP continues to lead from the front as recognized from \nglobal indexes \u2013we were ranked as the most sustainable \nelectricity company in the world by the Dow Jones \nSustainability Index2 and yet again recognized as one of the \nmost ethical companies in the world by the Ethisphere \nInstitute. \nESG Report 2021\nIn April, we also became part of the S&P Global Clean Energy \nIndex. \nEnvironment\nOur CO2 emission reduction targets were recognized by The \nScience Based Target Initiative (SBTi) as in line with climate \nscience requirements towards limiting global warming to \n1.5\u00baC. \nIn 2021, we reached 19.6 GW of renewable installed capacity \ncorresponding to 80% of our total capacity. We also achieved \n51% reductions in our scope 1 and 2 CO2 specific emissions, \nand 30% reductions in our scope 3 CO2 emissions, compared \nto 2015 levels. We continued to improve our energy efficiency \nproducts and services by offering decentralized PV solutions, \nelectric charging points for E-mobility and helping companies \ncapture opportunities powered by digitalization and \ntechnological advancements. Moreover, we continue to \nreduce our specific emissions throughout the years, with \n2021 figure being strongly penalized by the hydro crisis in \nBrazil, which prompted a high utilization rate of Pec\u00e9m \nthermal plant, dispatched by the Brazilian electricity system \noperator. Nevertheless we reiterate our commitment to \nachieve ~100 gCO2/kWh in 2025.\nIn 2022, we will step up efforts to reduce scope 3 emissions in \naccordance with the latest scientific data, aligned with the \nrecent SBTi 3 Net Zero Standard.\nSocial\nOur sustainability strategy is framed, by the UN\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and is anchored on detailed policies and \ncommitments.

An unusual \nintroduction to our first Sustainability Report, which \nwe have prepared in accordance with the internation-\nally recognized GRI Sustainability Reporting Stand-\nards? On the contrary.\nLoud and clear are the signals coming from our many \nstakeholders as they navigate a rapidly evolving, more \nsocially responsible marketscape. We are witnessing a \nfundamental shift in the statutory and regulatory \nframework in favor of responsibility across the board. \nThe financial markets now face the reality of natural \nresource overconsumption and the urgent need to cut \nharmful emissions. Customers now want information \nabout your carbon footprint, talented young recruits \nare looking for purpose and meaning in their work, \nand legislators are tightening regulations. Interroll was \nand is prepared for this shift, because we develop inno-\nvative, responsible solutions that will help propel our \ncustomers to new heights and success on the market \ngoing forward.\nOf course we have our work cut out for us. A signifi-\ncantly more holistic approach has to be taken to \ndemand-driven solutions than was the case up until \nrecently. What price do we have to include in our cal-\nculations for environmental impacts throughout the \nvalue chain? How do decisions change when the total \ncost of ownership of machinery has to be taken into \naccount to a greater extent in light of rising energy \ncosts? How do we convey our advantages to the market \neven more transparently? How can we continue to \nattract the best employees? \nWe are supremely confident in our ability to address \nthese pressing questions concerning the future. For \none, we have been working on these solutions for a \nlong time, leveraging both the challenges and opportu-\nnities presented to us along the way. And secondly, the \ndebate on how to combine profitability with responsi-\nbility is not only long overdue, but also provides us a \nglimpse of what progress can look like \u2013 for us and our \nsociety in the future.

And our long-standing \nguiding principle, the Golden Rule, has \nmeant we have treated each other and our \ncommunities with respect too. We have \nbeen innovating for over 110 years and \nhave taken on the responsibility of leading \nsustainable transformation in our industry.\nWe launched our sustainability strategy, \nOur Responsible Journey, in 2020 and, \ndespite the pandemic, continued to drive it \nforward in 2021. During the disruption and \nchallenges caused by COVID-19, our teams \nand I have drawn strength from this ongoing \nfocus on doing the right thing \u2013 today, and \nin the years ahead.\nWe know our customers love to travel and \nbe active. After the restrictions of the last \ncouple of years, the world is opening up \nagain and there\u2019s a renewed enthusiasm \nand respect for what travel affords us: \nexpansion of perspectives; tolerance and \nunderstanding; reunions with friends and \nfamily; and the sheer joy and appreciation \nof the natural wonders of our planet. In \n2021, as many people made up for a year \nwithout holidays, there was a return to \nmore domestic travel. In the year ahead, \nas vaccine programs help to further loosen \nthe grip of the pandemic, we anticipate that \nglobal travel will pick up again too.\nWe also know that our customers are more \nconscious than ever of the impact they \ncan have on the planet \u2013 and they expect \ncompanies they trust to help them be \nresponsible. We welcome that challenge \nby offering bags and lugage that are \nmade with the environment in mind, and in \nsocially responsible workplaces. I\u2019m proud \nto share with you the progress we have \nmade in the past year, particularly around \nhow we are making our products more \nsustainable. The Magnum Eco \u2013 our range \nof hard-side cases made with recycled \nmaterials \u2013 has set the bar incredibly high. \nWe are also actively exploring how we can \nmake our products easier to repair so their \nyears of service are extended, and how we \ncan help our customers recycle them at the \nend of their useful life.\nThis report also includes updates on our \nwork to reduce the footprint of our own \noperations, and to encourage good practice \nand positive impacts beyond our business. \nIn our chapter about How we are Supporting \nPeople, you can read about how our work \non diversity and inclusion is creating a \nsupportive environment for all our people.\nThank you for your interest in Our Responsible \nJourney.\nYours sincerely,\nKyle Francis Gendreau \nChief Executive\nProducts\nApproach\nEnvironment\nPeople\nPolicies\nData\n\nSamsonite ESG Report 2021 \n2\n27%\n61%\n12%\nNet sales \nby Channel\nDirect to consumer e-commerce\nRetail\nWholesale\nNet sales \nby Channel\n46%\n25%\n17%\n9%\n3%\nNet sales \nby Brand\nSamsonite\nTumi\nAmerican Tourister\nGregory\nOther\nNorth America\nAsia \nEurope\nLatin America\n40%\n34%\n5%\n21%\nNet sales \nby Region\n1%\n8%\n10%\n23%\n58%\n42%\nNet sales \nby Product \nCategory\nTravel\nNon", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

This sustainability report is therefore not only the usual \naccount of the last two years but also an opportunity to review the entire first period of our \nsustainability targets and to take a look at the future.\n\t\n\t\nThe results for the four focus areas of our commitment to sustainability vary. We made a \nsignificant reduction to our own emissions globally. Achieving our own targets is not the \nprimary reason for our happiness \u2013 rather it's the fact that we have been able to embed the \nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions into our culture. This is the best possible starting point \nfor future progress. We were also able to foster a shared understanding of how important \nemployees, their knowledge and their development are to the success and progress of our \ncompany. We also reached our first milestone with our most important raw material: milk. \nSince 2019, there has been a Switzerland-wide standard for sustainable milk. Our ambition \nfor waste reduction has failed. We have not yet managed to find a satisfying and permanent \nsolution to central food waste problems, and a circular economy is still a long way off, far \ndown a road paved with uncertainty.\n\t\n\t\nThe journey is the destination\n\t\n\t\nSetting concrete goals was and is important to us \u2013 and not only when it comes to sustai-\nnability. The same applies to achieving these goals by their target deadline. However, the \nmost crucial aspect is ensuring that the right path has been taken, and that these goals are \nintegrated permanently into our daily lives.\n\t\n\t\nWe are convinced that our commitment to sustainability, which focuses on selected topics \nof particular relevance, is the right path for Emmi. Not least because it is understood and \nsupported by our stakeholders \u2013 especially our employees. We are therefore sticking to \nthis strategy and our focus topics, setting ourselves more ambitious goals and introducing \njust one new topic for the next strategy period: water. Targets with a comparatively short \ntimeframe have also proved successful. They force us to focus and act quickly. In doing \nso, we rely increasingly on the cooperation between networks along our value chain \u2013 for \nexample in our commitment to a circular economy.\n\t\n\t\nOur new 2027 sustainability targets are complemented by our netZero 2050 vision, which we \nsee as a commitment to climate protection that surpasses what at first glance appears to be \na business imperative and, in particular, our direct sphere of influence. Although this vision \nextends past personal timeframes, we will continue to strive for that will bring immediate, \nmeasurable.\n\t\n\t\nKonrad Graber\t\n\t\nUrs Riedener\n\t\n\t\nChairman of the Board\t\nCEO\n\nEmmi Sustainability Report   |  2019/2020  |  The best dairy moments \u2013  today and tomorrow\t\n4\nThe best dairy moments \u2013  \ntoday and tomorrow\n\t\n\t\nEmmi is an international group of companies \u2013 anchored in Switzerland, active worldwide. \nOur actions are guided by our passion for the best dairy moments and a business model \ngeared towards sus", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

This commitment is deeply \nrooted in our culture and is reflected in our leading-edge products.\nOur purpose extends to the way we conduct \nour work, making sure we take care of our \nteams, protect our environment and support \nour communities, all of which are part of \nour larger, collective home. Whether it\u2019s our \ncommitment to maintain our best-in-class \nsafety records, operate efficient manufacturing \nprocesses, develop products with sustainability \nin mind or setting high supply chain \nstandards, we are looking beyond the house. \nIt\u2019s simply the right thing to do, and all our \nstakeholders benefit.\nIn addition to delivering outstanding financial \nperformance in 2021, we took actions to \nposition the Company for the future, including \nmaking progress on key Environmental, Social \nand Governance focus areas.\nEnvironmental Stewardship\nIn 2021, we set our first enterprise-wide \nenvironmental goals to reduce carbon \nemissions and use renewable energy, an \nimportant step in mitigating climate change. \nWe have identified three areas in which we \naspire to lead: water, wood and recycling. \nMoen\u2019s innovative Smart Water Network is \npaving the way for how consumers engage \nwith and monitor their water use, providing \nimportant information and functionality to \nspot leaks and detect the chance of significant \nwater loss before it occurs. The Smart Water \nNetwork is just one example of Mission Moen in \naction. Mission Moen is the brand\u2019s ambitious \ncommitment to create innovative water-saving \nproducts with a goal of allowing end-users to \nsave up to 1 trillion gallons of water by 2030. \nMoen is also making progress on its Mission \nMoen commitment to recover and repurpose \n2,000 tons of ocean plastic by 2030. \nWe continue to invest in more efficient capacity \nfor one of our fastest-growing brands, Fiberon, \nwhose PE composite products are made almost \nentirely from recycled wood and plastic.

We started as a small watchmaking business and have \ngrown into a diverse portfolio of brands, crafting traditional \nwatches, smartwatches, handbags, small leather goods, and \nmore. Prioritizing our ESG initiatives is a natural extension of our \ncompany\u2019s legacy to create better products that are not only high \nquality, but that also leave a lighter environmental footprint and \nsupport the livelihoods of people who design and produce them.\nWe are proud to present our first Corporate Sustainability Report.

In late 2021, as a part of our \nrebrand to Veris Residential, we introduced Embrace by Veris Residential, under which all our sustainability, \nDE&I, and philanthropy efforts reside. Throughout 2022, Veris Residential and our associates were \nhonored to receive many awards for our team\u2019s dedication to being a responsible owner/operator, further \nsolidifying our company as a leader in ESG.  \nDespite 2022 being our first year participating in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), \nwe earned a 5-Star rating with a score of 88 (out of 100). We were recognized among the highest 20% of \nthe 1,820 participant companies globally and received a GRESB Public Disclosure rating of \u201cA.\"\nWe are proud of all that we have accomplished on behalf of our stakeholders over the past 12 months. \nLooking ahead, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance our properties with amenities that \nmeet our residents\u2019 sustainability-conscious lifestyle preferences, empower our employees with the tools \nthey require to reach their full potential and mitigate our carbon footprint in support of our communities \nand the planet\u2014all while creating value for our shareholders.  \n \nThe Planet \nVeris Residential committed to reducing Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, an objective validated by \nthe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Last year, we shared that we were well on our way to meeting \nthis target, with 2021 Scope 1 & 2 portfolio emissions standing 36% below 2019 levels. Building on \nthis momentum, we are pleased to report that we not only met but exceeded our 2030 goal, reducing \nlike-for-like emissions by 54% as of year-end 2022 (compared to the 2019 baseline). Additionally, we \nsurpassed our goal of reducing our energy consumption by 20% by 2030 well ahead of schedule, cutting \nconsumption by 24% over the last three years.  \nWith these milestones complete, we have been focused on significantly enhancing our disclosure with \nrespect to Scope 3 emissions and are proud to cover more than 90% of our operational carbon footprint \nin our current disclosure. We have also set a new target to decrease our water consumption by 20% \nbetween 2020 and 2030. Further reducing our energy and emissions, as well as water consumption and \nwaste generated, will be largely impacted by our residents\u2019 behaviors. For this reason, and as part of our \nbroader resident engagement program, we have instated green lease amendments across 90% of our \nportfolio, outlining our residents\u2019 commitments to reducing energy and resource consumption.\nWe believe innovation in the real estate industry requires diverse perspectives, and as such, earlier this \nyear, we became a strategic partner to Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for Real Estate \n(MIT/CRE).

Now, responsible investing means being \npart of society\u2019s necessary path to decarbonization, \nwhere we already have industry-leading goals with \nour Science Based Targets and Net Zero commitment \n(see fact box). We are humble to the fact that we have \na big job in front of us to meet our decarbonization \ngoals: emissions reduction will for many companies \nnecessitate operational changes and cooperation across \nthe full value chain.\nWe will continue to sharpen our tools to be able \nto best support FSN portfolio companies on their \ndecarbonization path. We believe that one of our \nmost valuable assets in an uncertain future will be our \nflexibility and openness to adapt, as we together search \nfor the path to reach the bold goals we have set. One of \nour core values - growth mindset \u2013 is required for the \njourney ahead. \nThe private equity industry is in a unique position \nto both capture the investment opportunity arising \nfrom the green transition and to increase the speed \nof the transition by accelerating the growth of such \ninvestments. FSN Capital will continue the race \ntowards Net Zero by investing in companies that \ncan contribute to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions in a material and quantifiable way, such as \nObton and newly signed Polytech.\nAs always, we will do this with our Ultimate \nClients in mind: the millions of workers, students, \npensioners, and other citizens around the world, to \nwhom we aim to deliver attractive investment returns \nin a responsible way.\nThis year\u2019s report marks a milestone for our firm: \nfor the 10th time we are transparently documenting \nhow we choose to incorporate ESG into all stages \nof the investment process. As we work on meeting \nour bold goals, we will continue to report to our \nstakeholders on our progress, in the open and \ntransparent manner we have strived for since 2013.\n\u201cWe must all have the courage to set \nbold targets and work steadfastly \ntowards them.

Many of the persistent \nchallenges that humanity has faced during this period \nrequire continued attention, including combating climate \nchange, preserving natural resources, fighting COVID-19, \nand narrowing the digital divide. We are all learning to live \nwith the new reality created by these challenges that \ncontinue to cause broader concerns about peace and \nprosperity for all.\nThis rapidly changing context urges the global business \ncommunity to respond with smarter innovation and more \nresponsible operations, seizing every opportunity to act \nwith a larger purpose in mind. Business practices need to \ncomply with laws and regulations as well as high ethical \nstandards and moral imperatives. Lenovo is committed to \nour vision to provide smarter technology for all and \nhelping to decarbonize the global economy \u2013 one of \nhumanity\u2019s greatest challenges. With that, I am proud to \nshare our environmental, social and governance progress \nover the past year and our goals for the future.\nEnvisioning Net-Zero by 2050\nLenovo is fully committed to carbon footprint reduction in \nits operations. After exceeding our 2020 carbon emissions \nreduction target, we have set a vision of achieving \nnet-zero by 2050, and we are working with the Science \nBased Targets initiative to determine the goals that \nsupport this vision.\nFrom an innovation perspective, our Neptune liquid \ncooling technology, combined with our High-Performance \nComputing cluster, helps data center customers become \nmore energy efficient. For example, they enable our \ncustomer, DreamWorks Animation, to cut power \nconsumption by a third while increasing the amount of \ncomputing power per square foot of its existing data \ncenter by more than a hundredfold, which creates a \nreal-time rendering process for creative artists.\nLenovo has continued its focus on resource preservation \nand supporting a circular economy by increasing the use \nof recycled and recyclable materials in packaging, \nincreasing the use of bio-based materials, reducing the \nsize of packaging, and expanding the use of bulk and \nreusable packaging solutions that help to reduce carbon \nemissions. Since 2012, we have been using bamboo fiber in \npackaging, a renewable, bio-based and lightweight \nmaterial. We have continued to increase our use of this \nmaterial, and are now using it in the packaging for more \nthan one million products each year. In FY 2021/22, we \nexpanded our use of bamboo fiber to include the \nThinkPad X1 and Z series gift boxes, thus reducing the \ntransportation weight by 30 percent.\nWe have continued to expand Lenovo\u2019s renewable energy \ninstallation as we work to achieve our energy-related \ntargets. The total in-operation renewable energy capacity \nin our worldwide locations has now reached \napproximately 17 megawatts, with more in the plan.\nFurthermore, our efforts to effectively engage with \nsuppliers on climate change were acknowle", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 54.0}}}}

Changes \nbrought about from environmental, financial, technological, and political \ndevelopments have underpinned the need for organizations to be agile to \nface challenges and thrive. Organizations have the opportunity to adapt, \nreinvent themselves, and embark on new initiatives. At Globant, reinvention \nis central to what we do. It\u2019s why we exist. We believe that the success of \nany company is rooted in its ability to reinvent itself. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been \nenabling reinvention for our clients through intuitive and agile technologies \nthat help them create a way forward into a sustainable future.\nI\u2019m very happy to connect with you again today and share our annual results. \nIn 2021, we became a billion-dollar-revenue company for the first time \nand delivered a 59.3% year-over-year growth. This is the strongest annual \nrevenue growth since our Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2014. But even \nmore importantly, it affirms that our clients trust in our work and our team. \nOur amazing team of Globers grew by 45% year-over-year. We are now a \nglobally cohesive team of more than 23,500 creative minds, serving more \nthan 1,100 blue-chip clients around the globe.\nHere\u2019s probably the most important message that we can convey to inspire \nothers to take action: Why do we do all this? Simply because we care about \nmaking the world a better place, one step at a time. That is the greater \nreason behind everything we do, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so passionate about \nour mission.\nWe care about  growing  our clients\u2019 businesses and making them \nsustainable over time. Some of the most beloved brands in the world \ncount on us to help them solve their most complex challenges and strongly \nrecommend us. Globant\u2019s Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures how \ncustomers perceive our quality of service, was 64 for the past 12 months. \nAvailable industry benchmarks are generally between 30 and 40.  \nLetter from the CEO\nWe care about the environment. In 2021 we became a carbon-neutral \ncompany, and we committed to continue reducing our environmental \nfootprint in line with Science-Based Targets.

In my \nfirst year as Chair, I have drawn great confidence from the disciplined \napproach to governance at Pearson, and the high calibre of our \nBoard members. Their expertise and integrity have helped to cement \nour strong financial position in 2022 and to advance our purpose: to \nadd life to a lifetime of learning.\nStrategy and performance \nThe Board has been heavily engaged with the management team in \noverseeing the implementation of our growth strategy, with a \nparticular focus on embedding operational discipline around the new \nbusiness divisions. This has helped to \u2018right-size\u2019 the business and \nachieve significant efficiencies that have accelerated our margin \nimprovement expectations.\nA highlight of 2022 was the completion of the first year of Pearson+. \nWith 4.8 million registered users in that full calendar year, it is an \nimportant milestone in our journey to realise a digital ecosystem for \nlifelong learning. Developing our workforce skills strategy has been \nanother priority for the Board in 2022. With more than 2,000 \nenterprise learning clients, it is the next big opportunity for Pearson \nto support employers and employees through Assessment & \nQualifications, Workforce Skills, and English Language Learning.\nThe Board also continued to reshape and refine Pearson\u2019s portfolio \nin support of our strategy through both acquisitions and divestitures. \nIn 2022, we acquired consumer language learning app Mondly, a \ncornerstone of our direct to consumer approach in English Language \nLearning \u2013 you can read more about this acquisition and the Board\u2019s \nconsiderations in relation to it on page 69. Another consumer-\nfocused acquisition was the digital credentials platform Credly, \nthrough which we are tapping into the vast and growing focus for \nlearners to be able to evidence their achievements and progress \nthrough digital certification. It is also valued by employers to \nencourage skills development in their workforces and has issued \nmore than 50 million credentials, with some 70,000 new joiners a \nweek. Additionally, the Board oversaw the sale, through a number  \nof transactions, of much of our K-12 publishing businesses in \ninternational markets.\nThe Board was instrumental in assessing and responding to three \nunsolicited takeover approaches to the company from investment \nfirm Apollo Global Management. After careful consideration, the \nBoard voted unanimously to reject the approaches as we believed \nthey all significantly undervalued the company. We thank you, our \nshareholders, for your support in the Board\u2019s position. \nThe Board continued to pay close attention to maintaining a strong \nfinancial position, which enabled us to increase the dividend in 2022, \nin line with our progressive dividend policy. We were also able to \nlaunch a \u00a3350m share buyback programme, while remaining well \nplaced to pursue strategic opportunities as they arose, such as the \nannouncement in December of our proposed acquisition of \nPersonnel Decisions Research Institute (PDRI), which we look forward \nto completing subject to receiving the relevant clearances. \nAs part of monitoring execution and performance, the Board \nregularly receives a dashboard that allows Directors to monitor \nprogress on Pearson\u2019s financial and strategic priorities, supported by \nagreed indicators and milestones identified as key measures of \nperformance. While we work to embed the strategy, we will continue \nto refine this dashboard to ensure it includes the right key \nperformance indicators (KPIs) to monitor our progress. You can read \nmore about those KPIs on page 18 of this annual report.\nThe Board\u2019s oversight of performance and risk is underpinned  \nby the excellent work of our Audit Committee, which you can read \nmore about on pages 80-87, including a number of strategic risk \ndeep dives and a particular focus on data privacy and cyber security, \nas well as overseeing the important matter of our external audit \ntransition in 2022.\nSustainability, stakeholder engagement and culture\nAs the world\u2019s leading learning company, Pearson recognises its \nenormous potential to make a positive impact on people and the \nplanet, as outlined in our environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nframework, which you can learn more about on page 30. The \nReputation & Responsibility Committee has primary responsibility for \nmonitoring and inputting into Pearson\u2019s sustainability strategy and \ninitiatives on behalf of the Board, with more on this described in the \nCommittee\u2019s report starting on page 78.\nUnderstanding the views and priorities of all our stakeholders is key \nto running a successful, sustainabl", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Introduction\n4\n5\n\nAt HMC Group, we are committed to crea-\nting a brighter, healthier future for patien-\nts, communities and our planet.\nSustainability has been at the center of HMC Group\u2019s \nobjectives for years. At the beginning it had an emphasis on \nenergy efficiency, evolving to include environmental and so-\ncial issues in a more systematic way. Raising awareness of \nthese concepts increased following the earthquake that hit \nMirandola and the surrounding areas in 2012. During the re-\nconstruction period, HMC\u2019s priorities changed, we focused \non industrial and energy efficiency. This represented both a \nbusiness necessity, to create a competitive production mo-\ndel with low environmental impact, and a business imperati-\nve for a company with a high energy consumption like ours.\n2022 was the year we embarked on our true transformation \nby fully embracing sustainability. We have understood the \nimportance of acting in this direction and, starting from \nsmall daily gestures, contributing to improving the corpora-\nte impact. \nWe want to embark on a virtuous path with humility but also \nwith the ambition of being able to do our part for a better \nfuture. We know and firmly believe that a company must lea-\nve positive footprints along its path. Therefore, in December \n2022, we proudly made a sustainability commitment, beco-\nming one of the first Benefit Companies in the biomedical \nsector. Our declared commitment focuses on four key areas.\nHealth - We help health.\nImproving personal care, the health and well-being of patien-\nts at the time of illness and the quality of life in hospital \nfacilities.\nPeople - We help people.\nImplement concrete programs that concern the well-being, \nwork-life balance, home-work, travel and professional \ngrowth of our workers.\nCommunity - We help the community\nTo be a sustainable business model along the supply chain \nby helping to give value to the wealth of internal knowledge \nand skills and of the production district, thus supporting the \ndevelopment of local communities and the reference terri-\ntories.\nThe planet - We help earth.\nRespect environmental resources by reducing and contai-\nning the environmental impact of our activity. With this, our \nfirst Sustainability Report, we formalize and begin our long-\nterm commitment and measure what has been done in past \nyears. \nI would like to express thanks again to my father and all my \ncollaborators.

Sustainability requires special \nattention, because Haarslev is the global leader in \nmanufacturing equipment for the rendering industry. We \nare determined to embrace our global responsibilities, \nand we want to contribute to a better tomorrow for this \nworld.\nThe past year has been eventful and demanding for \nmany, with the world on its way out of the grip of \nCovid-19. We\u2019ve faced inflation, supply chain problems \nand \u2013 not least \u2013 the first war in Europe in eighty years. \nThe conflict between Ukraine and Russia has given \nHaarslev particular challenges, due to several projects \nwith Russian customers.\nFrom the very beginning, Haarslev made sure we \nwere fully compliant with all relevant embargoes \nand sanctions. Projects were firmly managed and \nimplemented, with special attention paid to embargo \nrequirements, as well as to contractual agreements with \ncustomers. There may have been certain legal avenues \nfor continuing some operations on Russian soil, but \nHaarslev decided to uphold our beliefs and values, and to \npull out of the Russian market to comply with these.\n2022 was also the year in which Haarslev welcomed me \nas the new CEO, and in which I took on the challenge of \nbringing Haarslev to the next level. A key part of this \nfuture focus lies in sustainability, which is central to our \nIntroduction\nA word from the CEO\nKim Christensen, CEO\n\u201cHAARSLEV IS DETERMINED TO \nHELP ENSURE THE FUTURE OF THE \nENVIRONMENT, LOCAL COMMUNITIES \nAND PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. WE WANT \nTO ENABLE ALL OUR EMPLOYEES AND \nCUSTOMERS TO NAVIGATE TOWARDS A \nBETTER TOMORROW.\u201d\n1\nBETTER TOMORROW\nAt Haarslev, we continue striving to make sure waste can \nbe made avoidable. Haarslev capabilities, solutions and \nproducts contribute to as many valuable resources as \npossible being recovered, upcycled and recycled.\nWe provide customers with reliable, effective technical \nsolutions that convert waste, by-products and co-\nproducts into oils, proteins and feed products that are \nvaluable, useful and responsible.\nIn so doing, Haarslev helps minimise the amounts of \nmaterial that get incinerated, buried in landfills or \ndisposed of in other resource-wasting ways. At the same \ntime, we maintain a strong focus on our own supply \nchain, as well as on reducing the environmental impacts \nentire purpose as a company.\nLooking at our 2022 ESG achievements, I am pleased to \nhighlight these important progress points:\n\u2022\t Scope 1 emission reduction of 12%\n\u2022\t Scope 2 emission reduction of 35%\n\u2022\t Scope 3 emission reduction of 6%\n\u2022\t HSE incident reduction of 44%\nof how we manufacture Haarslev products and solutions.\nWe hope this report will show you how Haarslev includes \nthis crucial Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) \nfocus to build value for our customers, people and \nour business. In the report, we present our 2022 ESG \ndata in comparison with previous years, showing the \nimprovements we are making, and will continue to make.\nI hope you enjoy reading this report, reflecting how we \nat Haarslev want to display initiative and to help ensure \nthe best possible future for the environment, local \ncommunities and for people everywhere.\nWe want all Haarslev employees and customers to \nnavigate towards a better tomorrow.\n4\nAnnual ESG Report 2022\n\nTAKING CARE OF TOMORROW\nAbout this report\nThis report seeks to provide readers \nwith the best possible overview of \nHaarslev\u2019s ESG performance for the \nfinancial year 2022, as well as a look at \nour ESG targets and ambitions for the \nfuture.\nThis report supplements the Haarslev Annual Financial\nStatement, which primarily covers financial \nperformance.

And Hilti is now also publishing its first sustain-\nability report. Why at this particular time?\nChristoph Loos: For decades, we have been dealing with \nissues that today would be considered typical sustain\u00adability \ntopics. For example, health and safety have traditionally \nplayed a major role for us \u2013 with regard to our employees, \nbut also with regard to the users of our products. Or think \nof the social commitment of the Hilti Foundation \u2013 we have \nalso been active in this area for a long time. But in view of \nthe challenges of climate change and the associated social \nproblems, we need to increase our efforts. With our sustain-\nability strategy, we have laid the foundation for addressing \nour activities even more consistently and \u00adcomprehensively. \nAnd we now intend to report annually on the progress \nmade in implementing this strategy. This creates transpar-\nency both internally and externally.\nMs. Frey-Hilti, as a member of the owner family, you \nwant the company to make a profit. Is Hilti able and \nwilling to afford expensive measures, for example for \nenvironmental protection?\nMich\u00e8le Frey-Hilti: Short-term profit maximization has \nnever been the goal, but the long-term development of \nthe company that serves all \u00adstakeholders. And of course, \nthat is only possible if we generate the corresponding \n\u00adfinancial resources. My grandfather, Martin Hilti, used to \nsay, \u201cProfit is not everything \u2013 but everything is nothing \nwithout profit.\u201d I am convinced that only a \u00adsustainable \napproach to business can ensure our long-term success. \nAnd by that, we also mean \u00adassuming \u00adecological and \nAn interview with Christoph \nLoos, Mich\u00e8le Frey-Hilti and \nPeter Rupp\nLET\u0313S \n\u200aTALK\nWith our sustain\u00ad\nability \u00adstrategy, \nwe have laid the \nfoundation for \n\u00adaddressing our \n\u00adactivities even more \nconsistently and \ncomprehensively. \nChristoph Loos,  \nCEO\nHilti Sustainability Report 2020\n2\nLet\u0313s \u200atalk\n\nsocial responsibility.

Previously, you \nled a business unit at Hilti. How much resistance do \nyou \u00adexperience from your colleagues, who are now \n\u00adexpected to change many things?\nPeter Rupp: None at all, actually. On the contrary: I have \nthe impression that we currently find that these doors \nare already open. And we are not starting from scratch \neither. There is a great awareness and understanding of \n\u00adsustainability at Hilti. That is why many colleagues I speak \nwith also welcome the fact that we are now addressing \nthese issues in a much more structured way. Because what \nwe have learned at Hilti also applies here: When we focus \non something, we achieve a high impact.\nWhat changes should employees be prepared for?\nPeter Rupp: We don\u2019t want to do everything differently than \nbefore.

Those ambitions come to life across our \nbusiness and are integrated in everything we do, from sustainable \noperations to responsible sourcing and inclusive hiring practices.\n\nOUR JOURNEY TO \nREDUCE EMISSIONS\nAs climate science has evolved, our environmental goals and \napproach have, too. Driven by data, we are leading the industry \nwith ambitious 2030 targets validated by the Science Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi) on our journey toward reducing emissions across our \nentire global portfolio while creating greater operating efficiencies. \nIn partnership with our owners, we reduced single-use plastic \namenities in our hotels, expanded our replacement of traditional \nlight bulbs with more energy-efficient LEDs, offered guests \non-property electric vehicle charging, and provided lower-emission \nchoices with carbon-neutral options for our meetings and events \ncustomers. We also opened what we believe to be the first net-zero \nhotel in the United States: Hotel Marcel New Haven, Tapestry \nCollection by Hilton. \nAdditionally, in 2022 we made a strategic investment in \nFifth Wall\u2019s Climate Tech Fund to support its work to deliver \ninnovative decarbonizing technologies to the real estate industry.\nOUR CULTURE \nOF RESPONSIBILITY  \nHilton is one of the world\u2019s largest hospitality companies, and \nwith more than 7,000 hotels around the globe, we recognize our \nresponsibility to be a leader as an inclusive workplace and to be \na force for good in the communities where we operate.

The universality \nand global appeal of sport means that the IOC and \nthe Olympic Movement have a special responsibility to \npromote a sustainable future for our world. This is why \nsustainability, together with credibility and youth, is one \nof the three pillars of Olympic Agenda 2020, the strategic \nroadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement. \nThe relevance of sport in society was acknowledged \nin 2015 by the United Nations (UN), when sport was \nhighlighted as an \u201cimportant enabler\u201d to achieve the \nambitious agenda of the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals. This recognition has strengthened our \ndetermination to make sustainability an integral part  \nof all IOC activities. \nSince the adoption of Olympic Agenda 2020, sustainability \nhas been made a priority for all activities of the IOC and \nthe entire Olympic Movement. Chaired by HSH Prince \nAlbert II, the Sustainability and Legacy Commission led \nthe development of the IOC Sustainability Strategy, which \nlays out the principles for the working practices of the \nIOC, the Olympic Games and the Olympic Movement  \nwith regards to sustainability. \nThis first IOC Sustainability Report serves as a \nbenchmark to measure our progress on sustainability \nand to chart the challenges that are still ahead. It \noutlines the steps we have taken to make sustainability \nan underpinning principle of all our activities. \nThere is much that has been achieved already. \nFor example, sustainability is now fully embedded \nthroughout the entire lifecycle of the Olympic Games, \nfrom the candidature to the planning and the delivery  \nof the Games, and through to their legacy. Thanks to the \nreforms of Olympic Agenda 2020, we have implemented \na new philosophy for the organisation of Olympic \nGames, with sustainability and feasibility at its heart. \nWith this new approach, our goal is to make the Olympic \nGames a catalyst for sustainable development of cities. \nThe universality and global appeal of sport means \nthat the IOC and the Olympic Movement have  \na special responsibility to promote a sustainable \nfuture for our world.\u201d\n\u201c\n2\u2002\nIOC Sustainability Report\nForewords\n\nThis report also shows how the IOC, together with \nNational Olympic Committees, International Federations, \nas well as athletes, is leading change through a number of \ninitiatives to integrate sustainability principles across the \nOlympic Movement. The IOC as an organisation must also \ndemonstrate its own commitment to sustainability. For this \nreason, sustainability principles are fully integrated into all \ndesign and construction aspects of Olympic House \u2013 the \nIOC\u2019s new headquarters building in Lausanne \u2013 which \nwill open its doors in 2019. In addition, sustainability is \nbeing embedded throughout our day-to-day business \noperations, both in Lausanne and Madrid.\nThomas Bach \nIOC President\nAs the role and relevance of sport in society continues to \ngrow, the IOC is determined to live up to its responsibility \nto build a sustainable future for everyone. In a world that \nis more interdependent than ever before, we know that we \ncan only make progress in cooperation and partnership \nwith others. This is why I call on all stakeholders to \ncontinue our work together to make the world a better \nplace through sport. \n3\u2002\nIOC Sustainability Report\nForewords\n\nEighteen months after publishing the IOC Sustainability \nStrategy, we are proud to present the first IOC \nSustainability Report, which highlights the progress \nacross the IOC\u2019s three spheres of responsibility \u2013 the \nIOC as an organisation, the IOC as owner of the Olympic \nGames and the IOC as leader of the Olympic Movement.\nTo ensure the respect of best practice, we decided to \ncompile the report according to the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI) Standards \u2013 Core Option, and it has  \nbeen independently assured by ERM Certification  \nand Verification Services.\nAlthough we still have more than two years to achieve  \nthe 18 objectives defined for 2020, you will see that  \nmuch progress has already been made. Let me highlight \nsome of the key achievements we have accomplished  \nto date through consultation, collaboration and  \nstrategic partnerships.\nSince 2015, we have engaged, as early as the Dialogue \nStage, on sustainability and legacy with cities interested in \nhosting the Olympic Games. Round-table discussions were \norganised with the Candidate Cities for the Olympic Games \n2024 on sustainability topics such as biodiversity and  \nclimate with expert organisations and commercial partners. \nWe visited the Interested Cities for the Olympic Winter \nGames 2026 with sustainability experts to identify and \ndiscuss challenges and opportunities.

As in \nthe previous years, this report has received \nthe \u201cIn Accordance\u201d rating of GRI Standards \nand is externally verified by Deloitte Haskins \n& Sells.\nITC\u2019s sustainability performance continues to \nbe acknowledged across the globe. We have \nsustained our \u2018AA\u2019 rating by MSCI-ESG, for  \nthe 5th consecutive year. We have also \nfeatured in the Dow Jones Sustainability \nEmerging Markets Index. Additionally, ITC has \nbeen rated \n\u2018A -\u2019 at the Leadership Level for Climate \nChange, Supply Chain and Water Security  \nby CDP.\nTwo Glorious Decades of Sustainability \nReporting \nThis Report marks a momentous occasion in \nITC\u2019s sustainability journey as we complete \n2 decades of reporting. The theme \u201cShaping \nthe Future\u201d encapsulates the pathways that \nwe have defined to pursue our vision of \n\u201cResponsible Competitiveness\u201d and contribute \nto a world that\u2019s greener and cleaner while \nsupporting livelihoods at scale. It is immensely \nheartening that ITC is today recognised as \na global exemplar in sustainability, having \nachieved many a milestone over the years \nwith multi-dimensional interventions that \nhave been innovative, inclusive and impactful. \nIt is a matter of pride that our innovative \nbusiness models have enabled ITC to achieve \nthe global environmental distinction of being \ncarbon, water and solid waste re-cycling \npositive enterprise for over 18, 21 and 16 \nyears respectively and support sustainable \nlivelihoods of over 6 million people.  It is \nimmensely satisfying that the first 12 LEED \nZero Carbon hotels in the world and the first \n2 LEED Zero Water properties are ITC Hotels. \nITC\u2019s Foods unit at Malur became Asia\u2019s first \nfood processing facility to be awarded the \nAWS Platinum level certification, the highest \nrecognition for water stewardship in the world, \nwhich follows a similar achievement for our \nPaperboards Unit in Kovai, the first site in India \nand the first paper mill in the world to achieve \nthis certification. ITC Sankhya in Bengaluru \nbecame the first data centre in the world to be \nawarded the LEED Zero Carbon certification. \nITC has also implemented large-scale \ninterventions for empowerment of farmers and \nrural communities. Today, many corporates \nare mainstreaming sustainability - some even \nembracing it as their core brand identity. \nHowever, it is evident that our collective efforts \nneed to be scaled up further to address the \nrisks posed by the mounting \nsustainability threats.\nA World in Permacrisis \nWe live today in a world of permacrisis \nand uncertainty. Unprecedented change \nis upon us given the mega threats of \ngeopolitical dynamics, existential climate \ncrisis, reglobalisation as well as technological \nadvancements and digital acceleration.

Terming 2023 as \nthe year of \u2018polycrisis\u2019, the World Economic \nForum has called out several areas, like climate \nchange, food and energy shortages, etc, where \nthe world is at an inflection point.\nThe threats of livelihood generation and \ngrowing inequalities are also making societies \nvulnerable. The stark inequalities of income \nand wealth are reflected in the fact that the \ntop 1% of the world\u2019s adults own around 48% of \ntotal global wealth, while the bottom 53% own \naround 1%.

In addition, KPN offers third party telecom providers access to our nationwide fixed and mobile \nnetworks.\n \n1.2\t\nOur Customers\nAs the market leader in the Netherlands, we are committed to millions of households and businesses. From \nmobile data users to households that purchase all-in-1 packages and business customers with ICT services and \nworkspaces. More and more customers are combining fixed and mobile services. Customer satisfaction is essential \nfor KPN. An important indicator for this is NPS (Net Promotor Score). The higher the NPS score, the more strongly \na customer would recommend KPN to others. \n1\t Introduction\n5.630 million\nMobile subscribers1\n1.485 million\nFixed-mobile households \n3.136 million\nBroadband lines1\n+15 \nNPS Consumer\n3.096 million\nFttH homes passed\n(own roll-out)\n+3\nNPS Business\nNote: data as per Q3 2021 \n1 Consumer and Business segments, excludes Wholesale\n Content\n\nSustainability-Linked Finance Framework\u2003 4 \n1.3\t\nOur Strategy\nThe core of our strategy is that we are speeding things up in line with the digitalization of society. Every day,  \nwe are working on the network of the future \u2013 a network of people and technology that facilitates progress.  \nWe are doing everything within our power to connect everyone in the Netherlands to a sustainable future.  \nWith our strategy \u2018Accelerate to grow\u2019 we are focussing on three pillars: \nWith this strategy KPN will grow mass-market service revenues and EBITDA and enable KPN to continue its \nprogressive dividend policy, covered by growing Free Cash Flow. It will also lead the Dutch digitalization wave to \nconnect the Netherlands to a sustainable future. \n1. Leverage & expand superior network\nKPN has built a state-of-the art network architecture with the vast majority of mobile sites built for high capacity \nand connected to fiber. KPN has already connected over one-third of households in the Netherlands directly to \nfiber. In the coming years KPN will leverage and expand this superior network by accelerating its fiber rollout to \napproximately half a million homes passed per year with the intention to cover 80% of Dutch households by 2026 \n(together with Glaspoort, KPN\u2019s joint venture with APG).\n2. Grow & strengthen customer footprint\nKPN is focused on growing mass-market services revenues through a strengthened and growing customer \nfootprint in the Consumer, SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) and Wholesale segments, which represent \napproximately 75% of KPN\u2019s revenues and 90% of its adjusted EBITDA AL. KPN will be the preferred digital partner \nfor households through (i) the best digital access with fiber, 5G, and in-home WIFI; (ii) the best digital  \nomni-channel experience with a mobile-first and app-centric customer approach; and (iii) the best third-party \nservices through entertainment partnerships. In Business, KPN has a clear segmented customer focus for SME,  \nLCE (large commercial enterprises) and Tailored Solutions. In Wholesale, KPN continues its open access policy to \noffer access to third-party operators with fiber contributing to continued growth of Wholesale revenues. \n3. Simplify & streamline operating model\nKPN will further simplify and streamline its operating model to prepare for the next wave of digitalization, which \nwill truly change customer experience, enhances KPN\u2019s time-to-market and contributes to a next wave of cost \nefficiencies. Along with portfolio simplification, digital customer journeys, and IT and network rationalization,  \nKPN is executing on COVID-accelerated cost opportunities e.g., moving to more remote working and \nan adjusted office footprint.\nThree strategic pillars\u2026\n...to support our ambition to\nAccelerate to Grow strategy supported by three key pillars\n1.

This has required \ndecisions of the Board in relation to the capital \nstructure of the Company and the business plan. \nUS$190m additional debt was raised in April 2019 \nto maintain liquidity but trading performance \nweakened further resulting in the Trading  \nUpdate\u00a0and Revised Outlook announced on \n24\u00a0July\u00a02019. \nTrading through Q3 continued to be weak, \nputting further pressure on liquidity and so the \nBoard authorised the drawing of further debt.  \nThis resulted in the raising of US$150m of Senior \nSecured Notes announced in September 2019, \nwith a potential to raise an additional US$100m  \nof Delayed Draw Notes. As a result, the Board \ncalled for a fundamental operational, financial \nand strategic review of the business.\nWith debt at heightened levels and cost of new debt \nonerous, the Board agreed a sizeable capital raise \nwas necessary in order to continue operations. \nTrading continued to underperform through the \npeak December delivery period resulting in a further \nTrading Update on 7 January 2020.

For over \n175 years, Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli has proudly lived up to this promise, \nbuilding a global reputation for excellence, innovation, and sustain-\nability. As we look forward, our purpose guides us to make a positive \nimpact and help create a better future.\nThe world faces many challenges, such as the deterioration of \nnature and biodiversity, which are the basis of life and our products. \nClimate change has the potential to exacerbate social conflicts and \nchallenge agricultural production of raw materials. Human rights \nviolations are still widespread, reinforcing inequalities and hindering \nthe improvement of livelihoods for many people.\nThe Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli Sustainability Plan is our ambition to help \naddress these challenges and to create a better tomorrow. It is our \npathway to becoming more sustainable along our entire value chain, \nfrom sourcing and production to packaging and consumption.\nWe continue to build on this solid foundation: in 2021, more than \n91,000 farmers participated in our Lindt & Spr\u00fcngli Farming Program \nand 100% of our cocoa beans and 64% of our cocoa beans equivalent \nare sourced through sustainability programs. Our first complete \ncarbon footprint has revealed that our greatest leverage to limit climate \nchange is in our value chain, namely in sourcing cocoa and other \nraw materials, as well as in transportation and packaging initiatives. \nThis footprint will enable us to announce our Science Based GHG \nReduction Targets in 2023. We also rolled out our Sustainable Pack-\naging initiative further, which aims to make 100% of packaging \nrecyclable by 2025 and to reduce the use of plastics.\nThis progress demonstrates that Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli\u2019s Purpose, Mission, \nand Values are anchored deep within our culture and in the hearts \nof our employees, motivating everyone along our value chain to \ncontribute to a more sustainable future.\nGoing forward, we anticipate a rapid increase and strengthening \nof social, environmental, and corporate governance regulations, \ngrowth in investor interest, and the allocation of more resources \ntoward sustainable solutions. There will also be increasing demand \nfrom our business, trade, and supply chain partners \u2013 as well as \ngrowing awareness and expectations from our employees, consumers, \nand the general public \u2013 for improved sustainability performance.\nThis encourages us to further strengthen Lindt\u2009&\u2009Spr\u00fcngli\u2019s good \nbusiness conduct. We consider business integrity and human rights \nas cross-cutting issues relevant throughout the Lindt\u2009&\u2009Sprungli \nSustainability Plan and our way of doing business.

We stepped up our efforts in three prio-\nrity areas, which respond to today\u2019s major social and \nenvironmental issues: protecting and restoring natu-\nral and cultivated biodiversity; delivering dramatic \nchanges to mitigate the climate crisis; and finally, \ncreating opportunities and empowering all people in \nthe communities in which we are engaged, with a \nfocus on women\u2019s empowerment. We want to conti-\nnue to consolidate the Group\u2019s and its brands\u2019 actions \nin these areas, which lie at the core of our responsi-\nbility as an international manufacturer and retailer of \nbeauty and well-being products.\nI am very proud to announce our first objective in this \nrespect: contribute to the world\u2019s carbon neutrality by \nachieving Net Zero emissions across the Group by \n2030 and on our two French production sites by 2025. \nInspired by the Science-Based Targets initiative, our \nfirst effort remains to avoid and reduce the Group\u2019s \nown emissions, and to achieve greater sobriety throu-\nghout our value chain. By 2020, we are well on track \nto achieving a 30% reduction of our carbon intensity \nfrom the levels of emissions recorded in 2010. While \nthese efforts to avoid and reduce our footprint across \nthe supply chain will continue to be our priority, this \nyear L\u2019OCCITANE Group will also initiate several car-\nbon sequestration projects. We will prioritise nature-\nbased solutions such as reforestation projects that will \nhave to offer the joint benefits of protecting biodiver-\nsity, sequestering carbon and improving livelihoods.\nSYLVAIN DESJONQU\u00c8RES\nL\u2019OCCITANE Group Managing Director\nREINOLD GEIGER\nL\u2019OCCITANE Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nThe L\u2019OCCITANE Group has been following a coherent \npath for years, with the unfailing ambition to preserve \nand regenerate biodiversity while also strengthe-\nning relations of trust and fair trade with all our \u201cpar-\ntner-producers\u201d of natural raw materials. The longe-\nvity of our programmes such as RESIST (Resilience, \nEcology, Strengthening, Independence, Structure, \nTraining) in Burkina Faso and the launch of new ini-\ntiatives such as the agroecology collective testify to \nour past and present commitment to \u201cbiosystems\u201d, or \nvirtuous ecosystems that are at once human-centred \nand rooted in nature.\nNatural, human, local: these are the three watch-\nwords that inspire and guide our daily work.

Together with our RBC Strategy colleague Sara\nMahaffy, we explore recent ESG investment trends, and provide detail of our coverage\nuniverse's sustainability efforts and goals across key restaurant-specific ESG categories, as\nidentified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\nThe growing importance of sustainable investing: By our estimate, we\u2019ve identified $476 billion in\ndedicated sustainable equity funds (with meaningful assets invested in the US), up from just $182 billion\nat the end of 2018. Net inflows into these funds have accelerated in recent years, with 4Q inflows on\npace to hit another new record. In terms of how these funds are positioned in S&P 500 Restaurants,\nSBUX is the only name that ranks relatively high in the actively managed funds within our universe. The\nother names (MCD, YUM, DRI, CMG, DPZ) either rank in the middle tiers or lower tiers of ownership.\nFurther improvements in their ESG profiles could allow them to tap into more funds.\nWe believe labor practices will be an area of increasing focus for ESG investors in a post-COVID\nworld: While energy usage, waste reduction and supply chain practices remain obvious ESG focus\nareas for restaurants, we see human capital management\u2014encompassing labor practices and employee\nengagement, diversity and inclusion\u2014as an increasingly important topic moving forward, particularly as\nthe industry continues to navigate the pandemic. Our belief is that human capital management not only\nimpacts brand perception, but is also of paramount importance to restaurants' fundamental business\nperformance. The brands in our coverage are responsible for approximately 18 billion transactions\nannually in the US alone (representing nearly a quarter of domestic restaurant sales), with the\nvast majority still involving face-to-face interaction between company or franchisee employees and\ncustomers, despite the rise of digital ordering. As such, service quality and operational efficiency\u2014which\nwe view as closely linked to labor practices and employee engagement\u2014can be a top-line driver for\nrestaurants, rather than another expense line item. Although external pressures (e.g. government-\nmandated wage increases) likely continue to place upward pressure on labor expense longer term,\nwe encourage investors to consider the offsetting benefits of continued investment in restaurants'\nworkforces.\nScale matters as the restaurant industry consolidates and large brands gain share\u2014but scale\nalso highlights the importance of sustainability efforts: A core tenet of our restaurant investment\nframework is that scale matters, particularly as COVID-19 has only accelerated share consolidation by\nthe largest brands. Scale benefits restaurants in areas such as product innovation and marketing, but\nalso in resources dedicated to sustainability, and we would highlight Outperform-rated MCD and SBUX\nas companies within our coverage with significant scale, and among those with the most sophisticated\nand detailed sustainability goals and disclosure. In spite of the larger spotlight drawn upon the biggest\nbrands, we believe our restaurants coverage has largely embraced the challenge and complexity of\ncrafting and executing upon sustainability strategies.\nESG factors have outperformed within the S&P 500 in recent years: We\u2019ve noticed the following key\nESG trends in recent years: (1) top S&P 500 holdings in dedicated, actively managed sustainable funds\nhave outperformed, including those stocks that are uniquely popular to sustainable funds; (2) S&P 500\ncompanies with better ESG risk profiles have outperformed those with worse ESG risk profiles; (3) S&P\n500 companies with the most improvement in ESG risk scores have outperformed those with the least\nimprovement on a sector neutral basis. Within the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary specifically, one\ntrend that jumped out to us is that companies with stronger workforce ESG scores have outperformed\nthose with weaker scores since 2011.\nPriced as of prior trading day's market close, EST (unless otherwise noted).\nAll values in USD unless otherwise noted.\nFor Required Conflicts Disclosures, see Page 41.\n\nTable of Contents \nIntroduction: Why ESG Matters in Restaurants ............................................................. 3 \nESG Inves", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

Precisely 2015 represented a turning \npoint boosting momentum on sustainability \nissues and on the concept that sustainable \ndevelopment concerns everyone and is the \nmost important contemporary challenge that \nno one can afford to miss out on. Indeed, \n2015 was the year of the Paris Agreement on \nClimate, of the Encyclical Laudato Si\u2019 and the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \npromoted by the UN.\nIn December 2019, the increasing impact of the \nclimate crisis led the President of the European \nCommission, Ursula von der Leyen, to present \nthe European Green Deal that aims to make \nEurope the first continent with zero climate \nimpact by 2050. \u201cThe pandemic, and the \nsubsequent economic crisis, prompted the EU \nto formulate a coordinated response both at \nthe cyclical level, with huge economic support \npackages adopted by individual Member \nStates, and structurally, in particular with the \nlaunch of the Next Generation EU programme \n(NGEU) in July 2020. The Next Generation EU \nmarks a sea change for the EU.\u201d1\nFor Italy, the NGEU represents an unmissable \nopportunity for development, investment and \nreform.\nIndeed, in this context, the National Recovery \nand Resilience Plan (PNRR) represents an \nextraordinary opportunity for economic \nrecovery and sustainable development for \nour country, structured around 3 strategic \naxes shared at European level: digitalization \nand innovation, ecological transition and \nsocial inclusion. The PNRR is structured \naround 6 Missions: digitalization, innovation, \ncompetitiveness and culture; green revolution \nand ecological transition; infrastructure for \nsustainable mobility; education and research; \ninclusion and cohesion; health.\nThe PNRR embraces the system ratio \npromoted by the 2030 Agenda, which \nconsiders sustainability in its 3 dimensions \n(social, economic and environmental), and \nidentifies 17 Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs) showing how each is closely connected \nto all others.\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were \ndramatic and, after an initial improvement \nin some indicators, resulted in a sharp \nslowdown in progress towards the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, with significant \nrepercussions at all levels.

We continue to \ntake inspiration from our purpose and our unique opportunity \nto use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve \nlives around the world. \nSustainable value creation is core to how we do business as \nwe work to advance global health, apply innovative science \nand ultimately protect and improve the health of people and \nanimals through the development and delivery of medicines, \nvaccines and technology solutions. We are passionate about \nthis work and committed to making a positive difference for \npatients and the world while driving strong business outcomes. \nWorking globally as One Team, we organize our sustainability \nefforts across four focus areas to create long-term value: \n1)\u00a0expanding access to health; 2) developing and rewarding \na diverse, inclusive and healthy workforce; 3) protecting the \nenvironment; and 4) operating with the highest standards of \nethics and values.\nExpanding access to health \nTwo years ago, we set a goal to enable 100 million more people \nto access our innovative portfolio globally, through access \nstrategies, solutions and partnerships, by 2025. We exceeded \nthis goal already in 2022. As a result, we increased our ambition \nand more than tripled our original goal. We now aim to enable \n350 million more people to access our innovative portfolio \nby\u00a02025.  \nWe are eager to reach more people not only now, but in the \nyears to come. To this end, we pursued new scientific discoveries \nwith an investment last year of $13.5 billion in research and \ndevelopment. In total, our products and pipeline seek to address \n83 percent of the top 20 global burdens of diseases.\nRobert M.

These investments support \nour goal to reach over 30 million people in low- and middle-\nincome countries (LMICs) and in U.S. underserved populations \nwith our social investments, by 2025.

The team\u2019s innovative \napproach to this work continues to \npush boundaries, and I am proud of \nthe significant progress we\u2019ve made \nover the past year. In the following \npages, we share the ins and outs of \nour approach to the environmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) issues \nthat matter most to us and our \nstakeholders. You\u2019ll see we\u2019ve set \nnew stretch goals and made notable \nprogress in priority areas, all while \nrecognizing a few setbacks, which \nwe share openly in the spirit of \ntransparency and accountability. \nIn 2022, we made significant strides \nin sustainability, with a specific \nfocus on denim \u2013 our largest \nvolume category. This year, we \nintroduced a dedicated denim \nsustainability strategy that brings all \nof our initiatives together under one \numbrella and ensures we\u2019re tracking \ntowards our goals. \nThere are two key areas of progress \nwithin our denim work that I would \nlike to highlight. The first is our \ncontinued commitment to circularity \nand keeping clothing waste out of \nlandfills. We hit a new milestone \nsince beginning our circularity \njourney and have collected over \n1.6 million garments to be resold \nor recycled through our trade-in \nprogram, operated in partnership with \nthredUP. \nSecondly, we\u2019re proud to have \nexpanded our Fair Trade reach, \ncertifying three additional factories \nand contributing nearly $1 million in \npremiums that directly benefit the \npeople who craft our products. \nAdditionally, you will find that we \ncontinue to step up our efforts \naround critical issues like the climate \ncrisis, biodiversity loss, and social \ninequality. This year, we launched our \nfirst program focused on protecting \nbiodiversity and made progress in \nadvancing regenerative agriculture \npractices. We believe these issues \nare critical to the long-term health \nof both our planet and our company \nand are taking steps to ensure we are \ndoing our part in an equitable way.  \nNone of this would be possible \nwithout the people behind Madewell. \nOur associates are core to our success, \nand we remain committed to creating \na positive and empowering place \nfor them to work. Our commitment \nto Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and \nBelonging (DEIB) is stronger than ever \nas we initiated company-wide DEIB \ntraining, launched branded pronoun \npins supporting LGBTQ+ inclusion, \nand partnered with Open to All\u2019s \nRetail Charter to reduce racial bias in \nretail.

As travel demand continued to recover in \n2022, there were still several major global issues creating \nchallenging conditions worldwide. Marriott associates \naround the world have been working hard not only to \nweather the crises and rebound, but also to continue \nhelping others and serving the communities in which \nthey live and work. Our associates\u2019 resilience is truly \noutstanding. As associates, guests, hotel owners, and \nfranchisees are increasingly seeking companies that reflect \ntheir values, we remain committed to Serving Our World.\nFostering an Inclusive Culture\nMarriott\u2019s commitment to associates truly sets our \ncompany apart. In 2022, I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve \nmade in attracting, growing, and retaining talent while \nworking to foster an inclusive culture where everyone feels \nthat they belong. We have been investing in associates \nglobally \u2014 through even more-competitive compensation, \nbenefits, and rewards \u2014 and we also expanded eligibility \nin the company\u2019s bonus plans for select associates. We \nwelcomed many new associates to Marriott last year, \nand we remained focused on growing great leaders at \nall levels and providing the right support. Core to who we \nare as a company is the sense of belonging. To that end, \nwe expanded the company\u2019s Associate Networks and \nlaunched executive-sponsored Associate Resource Groups \n(ARGs) to engage associates, enhance our culture, and \nsupport recruitment, retention, and diversity, equity, and \ninclusion efforts. Among these efforts is our goal to achieve \nglobal gender parity at the vice president level and above \nby the end of 2023.\nGrowing great leaders, investing in associates, and \nproviding access to opportunity supports a strong \nfoundation and we are proud of Marriott\u2019s associates, \nwho have been the drivers of the company\u2019s progress in \nenvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) efforts.\nHuman Trafficking Awareness Training\nWe have taken a leading role in the fight against one \nof the industry\u2019s most pressing human rights issues \u2014 \nhuman trafficking \u2014 and in December 2022, we reached a \nmilestone of having trained one million Marriott associates \nin human trafficking awareness. We donated our human \ntrafficking awareness training for use in the broader \nhospitality workforce, and by the end of December, \nnearly 850,000 hotel workers outside of Marriott had also \ncompleted the training. In addition, Marriott engaged with \nthe Global Fund to End Modern Slavery (GFEMS) to create \na hospitality training curriculum for survivors of human \ntrafficking and successfully piloted the training, with \nplans to scale the curriculum with service providers in the \nyears ahead.\nResponding to Global Crises\nIn the midst of global crises, such as the war in Ukraine, \nour commitment to our communities remained strong, \nwith hotels in the Marriott portfolio, associates, and guests \nmobilizing and lending support. Throughout the year, \nMarriot", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 30.0}}}}

Good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.\nAs you know, since we started the company, we were already energized by our mission, which is to deliver on the promise of mRNA science to\ncreate a new generation of transformative medicines for patients. What was very clear to us, because mRNA is an information molecule, is that we\nhad potentially in our hands a platform, a platform that could be very impactful to better the world. And so as we thought about building the\ncompany, it was very important to us to think about how do we build a responsible company in the holistic sense of the world.\nAnd as you can see, the framework that is on the right of the slide, we developed a framework that is about, first, of course, medicines for patients,\nwhich I will come back to and the team as well; also making sure that we have, of course, great talent; that we are a responsible company within\nour community; but also a responsible company with regards to the environment; and then, of course, because we wanted to be here for the very\nlong term, to build very strong governance and ethics principles to make sure that we could build the best possible version of Moderna.\nSo that framework was shared in 2018, on the next slide. We also issued earlier this year our first ESG report, which we, of course, would love to\nhave your feedback and input as we'll try, as always, to improve it over time to make it as useful as we can to you, our partners, our shareholder.\nOur goal today is to give you a bit of a glimpse into our progress and also our team and our thinking so that we can get, again, a good dialogue\nwith you to help us take this to the next level.\n2\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n\u00a92022 Refinitiv.

So as you know, of course, our #1 priority is to develop as many impactful\nmedicine, going after unmet medical need that we can. And as you know, we have a portfolio of vaccines for infection, which is in blue, and the\nportfolio of therapeutics. If you look at the vaccine portfolio, we are very excited about it, as you can see on the next slide because of what we can\ndo for patients around the world.\nOn Slide 8, please. It's basically the ability to prevent disease for literally hundreds of millions of people, prevent a lot of deaths, as you can see just\nright on the slide, and to make sure also that we can provide value to the health care system. We believe with aging of population, the current\ntrajectory of the health care system is not tenable. But we believe that Moderna can be part of a solution to prevent health care costs by preventing\ndisease.

Additionally, all currency references \nare in US dollars.\nValues in charts and tables may not sum to the total amounts \nshown due to rounding.\nSUPPORTING INDUSTRY EFFORTS FOR CONSISTENT AND \nCOMPARABLE REPORTING\nWe participate in several industry initiatives working to improve \nsustainability reporting. One such initiative is with API on its \nClimate-related Reporting Initiative. The aim of this initiative \nis to develop more consistent and comparable reporting of \nkey greenhouse gas (GHG) indicators in a template form for \nvoluntary use by individual companies. The initial version of the \ntemplate was released for use in 2021, and further details can be \nfound on the API website. For Murphy\u2019s API Template for GHG \nReporting, please see page 79. \nINTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASSURANCES\nWe recognize the importance of providing our stakeholders with \ncomplete and accurate data and information, and have therefore \ntaken the following steps in reviewing the content quality of this \nreport:\n\u2022\t\nInternal assurance \u2013 We streamlined our data collection \nactivities into an internally developed information system \nwith built-in internal control measures. Additionally, this \nreport was reviewed by a cross-functional management \nteam, subject matter experts and the executive leadership \nteam, as well as the Health, Safety, Environment and \nCorporate Responsibility (HSE&CR) Board Committee.\n\u2022\t\nExternal assurance \u2013 We engaged ERM Certification and \nVerification Services (ERM CVS) to conduct an independent \nassurance of our absolute 2021 total Scope 1 and Scope \n2 GHG emissions. For ERM CVS\u2019s Independent Assurance \nStatement, please see page 81.\nRESTATEMENTS\nAs we improve our sustainability reporting year-on-year, we \nnote that it may be necessary to restate our data. Reasons for \nrestatements could include changes in reporting boundaries, \nmetric definitions or calculation methodologies, or other \nreasons. For the sake of transparency, we will highlight the \nrestated items and reasons for restatement if we believe it would \nbe meaningful information.\nIn this year\u2019s report, we restated our 2020 gross operated Scope \n1 GHG emissions data and associated metrics. The primary \nreason for the revision was to correct the overreported flaring \nemissions for our Gulf of Mexico Delta House platform and BW \nPioneer Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) \nfacility. The overreporting was due to incorrect flaring emission \nfactors provided by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management \n(BOEM), which the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nMandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires offshore \noperators to use. The restatement resulted in the 2020 Scope 1 \nGHG emissions data being 14% lower than originally reported \nlast year. As described above, the restated Scope 1 data items \nare highlighted in the Performance Data section of this report on \npage 73. \nThe Murphy Oil Corporation 2022 Sustainability Report contains data and information \nregarding the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues essential to our \ninternal and external stakeholders.

In addition, it can reduce revenues and increase \noperation expenses, in various forms, of the business of NAVER, where data center is used as a \nkey asset, and is therefore expected to have a substantial impact on securing sustainable business \ncompetitiveness.

We declared a strategy that achieves \u201c2040 Carbon Negative\u201d \nby maximizing eco-friendliness effects through business activities and minimizing negative \nenvironmental impact that is triggered by business activities.\nCarbon Negative is a strategy of offsetting by reducing greenhouses gases more than the GHG \namount that is emitted, thus making the net emissions amount 0 or less. To achieve this goal, we \nhave set the following three detailed strategic directions and plan to expand relevant activities. \nBy \u2460pursuing operational excellence that enables us to reduce our environmental impact; \n\u2461developing future green products and services; and \u2462expanding external partnerships, we will \nactively take part in accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Introduction \n \nIn 2017, NZX released the NZX Corporate Governance Code (the Code)1 for issuers to report \nagainst under the NZX Main Board Rules. The overarching purpose of Code is to promote good \ncorporate governance, recognising that boards are in place to protect the interests of \nshareholders and to provide long-term value. It operates on a \u2018comply or explain\u2019 basis.  The \nCode is structured around 8 principles that cover a code of ethics, board composition and \nperformance, board committees, reporting and disclosure, remuneration, risk management, \nauditors and shareholders rights and relations.  \nOne of the key aims of the Code is to promote issuer disclosure of environmental, social and \ngovernance factors (ESG). In particular, recommendation 4.3 states:  \n\u201cFinancial reporting should be balanced, clear and objective. An issuer should provide \nnon-financial disclosure at least annually, including considering material exposure to \nenvironmental, economic and social sustainability risks and other key risks. It should \nexplain how it plans to manage those risks and how operational or non-financial targets \nare measured.\u201d \nIssuers may include other non-financial information, such as a description of the performance of \nan issuer\u2019s business against strategic goals. Non-financial reporting is new under the NZX \nCorporate Governance Code. An explanation of the \u201ccomply or explain\u201d nature of the NZX Code \nis included on page 5 of the NZX Code. \nAims of this Guidance Note \nThis guidance note is for NZX listed issuers that are considering the disclosure of ESG factors \nunder the NZX Code. It is built on the understanding that most businesses will have some sort \nof interaction with one or more of the branches of ESG. While not exhaustive, this guidance \nnote aims to help issuers better understand the benefits of ESG reporting and the global \nreporting regimes available.  \nThe NZX ESG Guidance Note aims to: \n\u2022 \nexplain what ESG is; \n\u2022 \nprovide issuers context on why it is important (i.e. its relevance under the NZX Code and \ninvestor demand);  \n\u2022 \nprovide issuers with resources for accessing more information about how to report on \nESG factors, including which global frameworks are available to them; and  \n\u2022 \nhelp issuers communicate their strategies for identifying and managing their materially \nsignificant ESG opportunities and risks to stakeholders and investors. \n \n1 https://www.nzx.com/regulation/nzx-rules-guidance/corporate-governance-code \n\n \nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE \u2013 DECEMBER  2017 \n4 of 19 \nThis guidance should help issuers identify the most appropriate global framework against which \nto report of the most widely recognised and used in New Zealand. The global frameworks \nidentified are not exhaustive and NZX recognizes that other frameworks not discussed here \nmay also exist, or be developed or evolve over time.  \n2. Background \u2013 What is ESG?  \n \nThe use of ESG disclosure is becoming more important in relation to investment decisions \nalongside other financial and strategic information. Issuers can show investors that they are \nequipped for the long term, and are ready to respond to risks and take advantages of \nopportunities. \nThere are three elements that help socially conscious businesses measure their sustainability \nand the ethical impact of", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Multiple challenges arose in different \ncountries and forced us to be nimble, in order to overcome the pandemic \ncircumstances. Despite this complex environment, during 2020 we have \nachieved a remarkable performance. Watching events unfold throughout \nLetter from the Chairman of the Board\nthe year, we were keenly focused on what we, as a corporation, could do \nto serve. I am proud of what our company and our hundreds of employees \naround the world achieved, collectively and individually, as a global, \ncoordinated and diversified organization. Neolith has demonstrated its \nability to help our end customers to enhance their own spaces through a \nhigh-value surface which allows them to create beautiful places in which \nto spend their time.\nIn 2020, we dedicated much of our efforts in continue innovating, not \nonly in product but in services, increasing efficiency in operations and \ninternational growth, that will set the fundations of the tomorrow\u2019s \nNeolith. And because a better future is not possible without an intense \nfocus on sustainability issues as well as neighborhoods and communities, \nwe aligned our ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) strategy \nwith the vision of being a pioneer in the building materials industry \nbecoming a key aspect of our brand positioning.\nThis means that our contribution to the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs) is one of the most important topics we cover in our \nSustainability report for 2020. The world\u2019s economic and political issues, \nthe scarcity of natural resources, and the increase in global disasters \nresulting from climate change require the roadmap of governments, \nbusinesses, and civil society to be urgently adapted. Aligned with this \ninitiative, Neolith performed an internal and external evaluation of ESG \nconcepts over 2020, where we defined certain specific actions to ensure \nsustainable growth and the company\u2019s long-term future. Evaluating our \nESG strategic plan in the context of the SDGs, we found our business to be \nin support of nine of the goals with a significant contribution to climate \nchange, decent work, and responsible consumption and production. \nI would like to end this introduction by expressing my sincere gratitude \nfor the employees, management, distributors, partners and shareholders\u2019 \nefforts in supporting and contributing to our business project, and the \nexciting transformation our company will undergo in the coming years.\nSagi Cohen\nChairman of the Board\nESG@neolith.com\n\n017\n016\nAs my first year as Neolith CEO, I wanted to dedicate \nall my experience and energy to sustainability \nmatters in order to unleash the Group potential to \nstand out.\nAt Neolith, our aim is to improve quality of life by \nproviding functional, sustainable products that \nmake people feel good, both indoors and outdoors.\nIn terms of social actions, we have made amazing progress on our zero-\naccidents goal and have seen an outstanding improvement, moving us \ncloser to our target. We have also identified opportunities to support \nour social environment through donations to hospitals and charitable \ninstitutions: organisations working with those most in need in our \nvarious markets around the world.\nInitiatives such as Neolith Six-S, an all-new collection that we launched \nin the middle of the pandemic, offers enhanced design, high-tech \nfeatures and advanced hygiene. We achieved this without sacrificing \nsustainability, and maintained our commitment to building a better \nworld.\nThe fight against climate change requires coordinated efforts between \ncountries and businesses alike. Neolith must play an active role in this \ntransition, and so in 2019 we achieved Carbon Neutrality, once again \n", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

This process is helping to reshape not \nonly our size and perimeter, but also the nature of \nour activities. It is precisely during such a significant \nyear that we launched our programme for a \nsustainable transition in accordance with ESG \n(environment, social and governance) pillars. \nA full-fledged paradigm change through which we \nintend to make sustainability the foundation of our \nbusiness strategy, aligning it with our values of \npaying attention to the society and environment in \nwhich we operate.\nOur mission is to offer an accessible, secure and \ncomfortable home. And we also wish to do the \nsame for our bigger (common) home, the Earth. \nOur solutions are a valid ally in reducing the \nenvironmental impact of buildings.\nWe have combined this \u201cenabling\u201d role with a \ncommitment to reduce our ecological footprint \nand contributing actively to the fight against \nclimate change. This is why we have begun to \ncalculate our organisation\u2019s direct and indirect \ngreenhouse gas emissions. An important analysis \nthat allowed us to understand that the use phase \nof our products is the part of the value chain that \naccounts for most of our emissions. Therefore, \nthis is the phase that we wish to focus on, to \nimprove the energy performance and environmental \nrequirements of our systems. \nAs part of this effort, starting in 2022 we are \nbenefiting from extending EPD certification (which \ndescribes the environmental performances of the \nlife cycles of products and services) to our entire \nproduction process in order to expand our range of \ngreen solutions.\nIn other words, we now have a precise snapshot of \nour footprint and can continue in the right direction: \nthat of greater respect for the environment.\nYet we could not make such important \ncommitments without an adequate governance \nstructure. We have created a sustainability function \nthat sets goals, monitors performance and ensures \nthat everyone has all the right tools to embark on \nthis journey.\nA journey we could not undertake without the \nfundamental contribution of our people. \nWe believe in an approach to work on a human \nscale that also takes into account the wellbeing \nof our employees, combining stable employment \n(95% of contracts are permanent) with the \npromotion of a healthy, active lifestyle. \nWe intend to continue in this direction even now \nthat we have over 3,000 Nice People.\nWe have become a large group, but above all we \nwant to be One Company: a closely knit team with \na shared vision and goals. \nWe want to expand our ability to include and \nharness diversity: to increase the presence \nof women in positions of leadership, bring \nmulticulturalism to all levels of the hierarchy, ensure \nequal employment and career opportunities to \npeople with disabilities and extend change across \nthe entire organisation.\nAt Nice, the foundations have been laid for a \nsustainable, inclusive new phase. \nIt is for this reason, among others, that the first \nreport is entitled: \u201cWelcome to the Nice Future\u201d. \nWe stand at the brink of a major change that poses \nmany challenges: in these pages, we aim to share \nwith you the milestones we have reached and the \nambitious goals that lie ahead of us.\nEnjoy your reading,\nLetter to our stakeholders\nLauro Buoro, \nFounder & Chairman\nRoberto Griffa, \nChief Executive Officer\nLauro Buoro\nFounder and Chairman\nRoberto Griffa\nChief Executive Officer\n\n6\n7\nContents\nLetter to our stakeholders \t  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  4 \nScenario \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  8                \n               \nNice to meet you  \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n10\n\t\nAbout us \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n12\n\t\nWhere we work \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n14\n\t\nOur history \t  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n18\n\t\nMain events in 2021 \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n20\n\t\nMission and values \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n22\n\t\nOur solutions \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n24\n\t\nOur projects \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n26\nThe Nice journey to sustainability \t\n\t\n\t\n28\n\t\nOur approach to sustainability \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n30\n\t\nStakeholder engagement \t \t\n \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n32\n\t\nStakeholder communication \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n34\n\t\nMateriality matrix \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n36\n\t\nOur goals \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n38\n\t\nThe Nice governance, strong company\t\n\t\n40\n\t\nGovernance bodies \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n42\n\t\nAnti-bribery and corruption procedures \t\t\n\t\n\t\n45\n\t\nCustomer privacy \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n46\n\t\nEnvironmental compliance \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n47\n\t\nSocioeconomic compliance  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n48\n\t\nTax strategy \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n48\n\t\nEconomic value generated and distributed\t\n\t\n\t\n50\nThe Nice environment, gentle footprint\t\n\t\n 52\n\t\nClimate action\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  54\n\t\nEnergy consumption \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n  58\n\t\nSmart and home automation for the environment  \t\n\t\n  62\n\t\nMateri", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

It aims to lead the way in the \ndecarbonisation of the aerospace industry, to unite and \nsafeguard the citizens of the world, and continually expand \nhuman knowledge of our universe, from critical events on earth \nto the exploration of space. To this aim, the Company designs, \nmanufactures and delivers aerospace products, services and \nsolutions to customers on a worldwide scale bringing essential \nvalue to society and contributing to the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (\u201cSDGs\u201d) through its core business and \nhow it runs it.\nFirst of all, the Company connects. Connections are vital \nto making the world a better place. That\u2019s why the Company \nunites people and organisations across the globe; physically \nwith its commercial aircraft and helicopters; and virtually with its \nconnectivity solutions, allowing them to connect and understand \neach other.\nThe Company serves communities. Its satellites and tracking \nsystems help make oceans safer with solutions that monitor and \nprotect naval routes and maritime assets. Company-built aircraft \nare instrumental in firefighting, in maintaining energy systems and \npublic safety. Its helicopters are the workhorses that carry out \nconstruction and infrastructure projects in hostile or inaccessible \nareas of local communities as they can often be the only tool \nable to transport heavy loads, building materials, supplies, cargo \nand more. Technology solutions from the Company protect many \ncritical systems from cyberattacks.\nThe Company saves lives. When a humanitarian crisis arises, its \naircraft help transport patients for urgent medical care, and they \nassist in search efforts to find those marooned at sea, stranded \nin the mountains, or isolated in remote regions. Its EO satellites \nare tasked to acquire images of the concerned area. This imagery \nis delivered to relevant authorities, together with archived data, \nto rapidly assess the extent of damage and support rescue \nplanning by allowing actions to be prioritised, and identifying if \nroads, bridges and airport runways are still operational.\nThe Company protects. Its defence products and services help \ncountries protect their citizens, values and vital infrastructure. In \nan unstable world, this security is a prerequisite of peace, the rule \nof law, political stability, democracy, environmental sustainability, \nhuman rights, economic development and prosperity, and \nscientific progress. The Company manufactures helicopters, \nfighter jets and military transport planes that allow nations to \nsafeguard their airspace and respond to natural disasters. \nThe Company supplies intelligence capabilities as well as \nterrestrial space and cyber security services. It provides secure \ncommunications to governments and organisations devoted \nto public safety. All help to make the world a safer place. Its \ndefence activities contribute to diplomacy, conflict resolution and \na multilateral approach to international relations. By supplying \nEU and NATO member states with advanced military equipment, \nit strengthens their diplomatic influence and credibility on the \nglobal stage \u2013 and in turn that of international institutions such \nas the UN and NATO, thereby contributing to SDG 16\u00a0\u2013 Peace, \nJustice and Strong Institutions.\nThe Company explores. It believes the exploration of our \nuniverse will enrich life for generations to come.

As part of our promise to deliver \non our purpose \u2013 We Protect and Beautify the World \n\u2013 we\u2019ve set new, ambitious 2030 environmental, \nsocial and governance (ESG) goals that will guide \nour continued efforts. We\u2019ve established a stronger \nfocus on decarbonization, including emissions \nreduction targets that have been validated by the \nScience Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets \ninclude PPG\u2019s first scope 3 emissions reduction \ntarget, an ambitious goal that will require working with \npartners throughout our value chain to collaborate on \ngreenhouse gas reduction strategies. The full set of \n2030 targets are outlined in more detail in this report.\nWe succeed by helping our customers succeed, \npartnering with them to create industry-leading \nsustainable innovations that help improve productivity. \nFor example, we\u2019re working alongside Steelcase, \nan American manufacturer of architecture, furniture \nand technology products, to identify new uses for \nwaste from our industrial coatings and support the \ncircular economy. Last year, we made approximately \n250,000 pounds of recycled coatings from powder \ncoatings used by Steelcase by reclaiming overspray \nthat would have otherwise been sent to a landfill. \nWhile we\u2019ve recently partnered with customers on \nnew, industry-leading technologies, our sustainable \ninnovations span decades. For nearly 20 years, the \nPPG B1:B2\u2122 process has helped automakers around \nthe world halve their energy consumption in the most \nenergy intensive areas of their manufacturing facilities \n- the paint shop - by eliminating a step in the curing \nprocess.\nSustainably advantaged products and processes \nmade up 39% of PPG\u2019s sales last year, and we \nexpect that they will comprise half of our product \nsales by 2030. Throughout this report, you will see \ncountless examples of PPG\u2019s products that are \nmaking tangible contributions to a more sustainable \ntomorrow - extending the useable lifespan of bridges \nand buildings; reducing energy use and greenhouse \ngas emissions by eliminating curing stages for our \nautomotive coatings and sealants; enabling aluminum \nfood and beverage packaging to be infinitely \nrecyclable; and even improving the fuel efficiency of \nairplanes and cargo ships.\n    Sustainability @ PPG            Products            Environmental            Social            Governance            Transparency\n\n05  |  PPG ESG Report 2022\nThese innovations don\u2019t happen without the \ndedication of PPG People.

The path out of the COVID-19 pandemic for our economic and social system had a \nmajor impact on the trajectory of the company, which managed to relaunch its commercial \ncapability, along with its determination to invest in growth and development.\nThe decision to take the company off the stock market should be interpreted in this sense, \nas the starting point of the owners\u2019 desire to guide the Group towards its future path \nwith ever greater willingness and commitment. Although this exit freed us from reporting \nobligations, we still wished to report on our activities, goals and results with regard to \nsustainability, continuing a commitment that remains central to our corporate mission.\nIndeed, corporate responsibility and sustainability are among the cornerstones of this \nmission. This led to: \na) continued investment in thin slabs, a product that is highly sustainable and in which we \nhave been one of the pioneering ceramic companies;\nb) a renewed commitment to provide products for healthy and safe environments with \nour unique Protect\u00ae antibacterial technology;\nc) the launch of an ambitious Sustainability Plan, which includes a series of important initiatives \nand goals to achieve in the medium term, covering 3 fronts: Planet, Prosperity and People.\nPeople continue to be one of the mainstays of our entrepreneurial work. Starting with \nthe care and protection of our employees, as well as with the development of relations \nwith the communities and areas in which we operate. What happened during the Covid \nemergency severely tested our beliefs and models, as well as the true depth of our \nresponsibility in our approach to business.\nAlthough there are still many uncertainties at a global level, we are emerging from this year \nwith a lot of hard work and an even stronger awareness that our roots are solid and our \nvocation for responsibility is strong, allowing us to face the crisis with a sincere and \nnatural priority for people, while safeguarding the continuity of our business. In other \nwords, social and economic responsibility, attention to our employees, their health \nand their families.\nLetter\nto stakeholders\n\nThe emergency has exposed the growing need to promote development models that \nare increasingly focused on people\u2019s well-being and on strengthening a sense of \ncommunity. Panariagroup has responded quickly and decisively, leveraging the strength \nand experience gained from almost 50 years of history faced with a great spirit of \nresilience and with the ability to respond to changes, adapting and evolving with a focus \non sustainability. In the meantime, the company has continued to invest in its own \ndevelopment with significant industrial and plant interventions, aiming to renew itself \nand become increasingly better equipped for future challenges. This has been our way of \ndealing with this phase, together with all our employees, whom we thank for the passion, \ncommitment, reliability and dedication to the company that they have continued to \ndemonstrate even at such difficult times. This is all achieved with a consistently high level \nof performance in environmental terms, as well as stable relations with our employees, \nwhich has always been one of our key strengths. \nThis new edition of the Sustainability Report also illustrates, in an even more incisive \nway, how we approach our commitment to the Global Compact and the SDGs \nestablished by the United Nations in order to strengthen our mission as a company \nthat plays a leading role not only economically but also socially and environmentally, \nwhile also featuring a wealth of data and information designed to provide an in-depth \nrepresentation of our daily work.\nPanariagroup increasingly wishes to be the driving force behind a shared development \nproject: we will tenaciously pursue this ambition, adapting and responding to constantly \nchanging scenarios and continuing to raise our responsibility to new levels.\nEmilio Mussini\nPresident of Panariagroup\n\n1\nP. 11 SUSTAINABILITY FOR PANARIAGROUP\n1.1 NOTE ON METHODOLOGY\n1.2 OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY\n1.3 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS): PANARIAGROUP\u2019S CONTRIBUTION\n1.4 PARTICIPATION IN THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT\n1.5 THE GROUP\u2019S STAKEHOLDERS AND RELATIONSHIP CHANNELS\n1.6 MATERIALITY ANALYSIS\n1.7 SUSTAINABILITY GOALS\n2\nP. 43 THE GROUP\n2.1 GROUP PROFILE\t\n2.2 HISTORY\n2.3 PANARIAGROUP WORLDWIDE\n2.4 THE GROUP\u2019S VALUES AND PRINCIPLES\n2.5 ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE AND GOVERNANCE\n2.6 SUSTAINABILITY RISK MANAGEMENT\n2.7 INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCE\nP. 6\nP. 8\nOUR COMMITMENT\n2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n3\nP. 69 ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY\n3.1 THE GROUP\u2019S ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY\n3.2 GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED ECONOMIC VALUE\n3.3 2021 FINANCIAL RESULTS\n3.4 INVESTING IN INNOVATI", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

By remaining laser-focused on our purpose, we were able to \nachieve unprecedented progress in helping to address some of the world\u2019s \nmost pressing challenges. I also realize there is still more we need to \ndo, significant inequities that must be overcome, and real threats to our \nsociety and environment that lie ahead. I am confident we can rise to any \nchallenge, just as we have in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nMy confidence is grounded in my belief that Pfizer is fundamentally a \ndifferent company today than it was just two years ago. By applying the \nlessons learned from our work to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and oral \ntreatment1, and by further embedding Environmental, Social & Governance \n(ESG) principles into our core operations, we have transformed the way \nwe discover, develop, finance, and deliver breakthroughs that change \npatients\u2019 lives. At the same time, external forces transforming societal and \nenvironmental norms, along with our internal commitment to equity as \none of our core values, have reinforced the importance of integrating ESG \ninto our day-to-day activities. \nIn 2021, we continued to focus on ways to make a meaningful and \nmeasurable impact. Never before has our impact been so wide-reaching \nwhen it comes to the number of patients treated or vaccinated with a Pfizer \nproduct. We reached an estimated 1.4 billion1 patients with our medicines \nand vaccines \u2013 roughly one out of every six people on Earth. Even when \nwe separate out our breakthrough COVID-19 products, we treated an \nestimated 424 million patients globally.\nOur ESG strategy includes six priority areas: product innovation; equitable \naccess and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and \ninclusion; climate change; and business ethics. Our progress on these \nareas is detailed in this report, and we look forward to engaging with \ncolleagues and other stakeholders to hear how we can continue to \nenhance our impact, both within and outside of Pfizer. We also continue \nto refine the metrics we use to measure our performance as the voluntary \nand emerging regulatory frameworks governing ESG reporting evolve at \nthe national, regional and global level. \nBreakthroughs and bold ambition\nThe significance of \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d has never been clearer than it is today \nas we continue to face COVID-19 variants and as unacceptable rates of \nmorbidity and mortality from the virus endure. We are unwavering in our \ncommitment to applying science and the dedication of our workforce to help \nend the pandemic and address inequities.  \nWe also recognize that even as some people have received a booster dose \nof our vaccine, others are still waiting for their initial dose. We continue to \nbelieve we will more rapidly reach more people with our COVID-19 vaccine \nby continuing to scale our manufacturing capacity while maintaining quality \nand safety through the last mile.

On the other hand, \nit is our starting point of reference for the coming years to impartially measure \nthe effectiveness of our efforts to achieve climate neutrality, demonstrate \nsocial responsibility in what we do as an institution and as people, and actively \ncare for transparency of our structures, management mechanisms, and our \nmost precious value: our employees. And finally, we have launched the ESG \nreporting in the year our Bank celebrates its 30th anniversary. This is the \nturning point and the best possible moment to clearly mark the beginning \nof a new period of operation of Bank Ochrony \u015arodowiska, the next step in \nthe implementation of the mission that has been the foundation of our \norganisation.\nThe year 2020 was unique in many ways. The COVID-19 pandemic changed \nour reality for good and has been a huge challenge, both personally for each \nof us and for the Bank as an institution. \nTogether with the entire Management Board of the Bank, I am proud that \nwe coped well in this difficult time, while supporting our clients by offering \nproducts and solutions that help them function \nduring pandemic constraints, especially those \ndirectly related to our Bank\u2019s mission: supporting \nthe green transformation of the Polish economy . This \nproves that we are able to operate effectively, efficiently \nand flexibly, even in extraordinary circumstances we do not \nto lose sight of what is most important for us - the good of our \nclients - people and companies that have trusted BO\u015a. At the same time,  \nin everything we did, we had in mind the Bank\u2019s core values: professionalism, \ncooperation, commitment, as well as respect for others and the environment.  \nOur Bank has been supporting environmentally friendly projects since it has \nbeen established. This is the idea behind the foundation of BO\u015a, contained \nin its name and defining the main mission. Hence, implementing the ESG \nStrategy, earning an ESG rating and non-financial reporting are natural course \nof development for BO\u015a. Moreover, at the dawn of the green transformation, \nas a specialist bank we are pursuing our ambition, to be a role model for the \nwider market in this area, shaping standards and good practice. We are also \nkeen for this to be clearly reflected in the product offering of BO\u015a. \nThe share of pro-environmental loans in the portfolio of Bank Ochrony \n\u015arodowiska was over 36% at the end of 2020. In this respect we are far ahead \nof all other banks in Poland and we are working hard to ensure that this \nproportion is constantly increased. For years we have not financed projects \nthat have a negative impact on the environment.\nLetter from the President\n3\nESG Report  \nBank Ochrony \u015arodowiska S.A. for 2020\n\nLast year, we concluded nearly 4,000 pro-ecological tran", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "recycled_waste_percent": 50.0}}}}

Held as a hybrid event, it was an important step in our personal and constructive\nexchange with our stakeholders during these challenging times.\nProfessor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, one of the world\u2019s most distinguished climate researchers and Director\nEmeritus of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, held a keynote speech in which he called for far\ngreater determination in our e\ufb00orts to protect the climate. In his impressive lecture, he demonstrated with great\nexpertise and fervour how little time we have left to limit climate change to a manageable level. As dramatic as the\nchallenges ahead of us may be, however, the outlook for the future remains optimistic: We are still in a position to\nachieve a radical reduction in greenhouse gas emissions within this decade. But as Schellnhuber emphasised: \u201cThe\ntime to act is now!\u201d\nGRI 102-14\nForeword by Lionel Souque\n\nFor us at the REWE Group, this sentence is both a mandate and a motivation. Global warming and loss of biodiversity\nare without a doubt the two greatest ecological problems of our time \u2013 and they both have a direct impact on our\nnutritional security, which means we cannot a\ufb00ord to put them o\ufb00. We consider it our responsibility as a company to\ndo our part in helping to alleviate these problems. REWE is therefore going to support the new NABU climate fund of\nour long-standing partner NABU with at least 25 million euros over the next \ufb01ve years. Together we are launching the\nlargest moorland restoration project for agricultural use in Germany, and we believe that strengthening and creating\nnatural carbon sinks has huge potential to e\ufb00ectively protect the climate.\nAnother major milestone on our journey: The REWE Group intends to purchase green electricity from a new o\ufb00shore\nwind farm in the North Sea from 2025 onwards. Energy supply plays a strategic role in the context of our climate\ngoals: We are a green power pioneer in the German food retail sector. Our stores have been completely using power\nproduced from renewable sources since 2008. By signing a corporate power purchase agreement (CPPA) for the new\nBorkum Ri\ufb00grund 3 wind farm, we are now the \ufb01rst food retailer to go one step further: We are directly promoting the\nexpansion of renewable energies and taking on process responsibility as well as a more active role within the energy\ntransition.\nMoreover, we want to make it easier for our customers to opt for electric mobility by massively expanding the electric\ncharging station infrastructure \u2013 because we will only succeed in stopping climate change if we as a society\nundertake maximum e\ufb00orts in all areas of life. That is why we are increasingly relying on state-of-the-art fast-charging\nstations that allow our customers to conveniently charge their electric vehicles while they shop. This, I am sure, is just\nwhat is needed to further accelerate the spread of electric vehicles. Our goal is to establish one of the largest and\nmost modern fast-charging networks in Germany \u2013 with at least 2,000 fast-charging stations and 4,000 additional\ncharging stations at selected REWE and PENNY stores throughout Germany by the end of 2024.\nDear readers, these are just a few examples to show you that we are continuing to take responsibility and use our own\ninnovative strength to actively tackle challenges and develop solutions. Some 15 years have passed since we decided,\nout of conviction, to pursue the goal of becoming an ever more sustainable company. This is how we know that doing\nbusiness \u2013 and living \u2013 in a more sustainable way is an ongoing process. And the last two years in particular have\nshown us just how quickly we can be stripped of what we believed to be certainties.\nIn times like these, it is therefore more important than ever to show solidarity and hold together. On this note, I would\nlike to express my particular gratitude once again to all employees of the REWE Group in Germany and abroad, as well\nas to our independent retailers, whose extraordinary commitment has ensured that our company has come through\nthe crisis largely unscathed up to this point. And more than that: In moments of deep despair \u2013 such as the\ncatastrophic \ufb02oods in the Ahr valley in the summer of 2021 or the terrible war of aggression on Ukraine \u2013 their\nwillingness to help knows no bounds. From donating goods and money, to organising relief transports at short notice,\nto providing permanent voluntary support: The commitment of our employees makes me very proud indeed.\nAs a cooperative company that has been in business for 95 years, sustainability for us means, ", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

In 2022, we have invested signi\ufb01cantly in our sustainability work: We have conducted a materiality \nassessment, developed a sustainability strategy, conducted a climate risk assessment, and complied with the \nexpectations and regulation in the Transparency Act, and Equality and Anti-Discrimination Act.  \nThrough transparency and dialogue with all of our stakeholders, including our workforce, our customers, partners, \nand investors, we are building trust. With our \ufb01rst ESG report, we push on that dialogue by providing more insight \ninto the steps we have taken this past year to integrate sustainability and ESG into our culture and corporate \nstrategy. Our goal is that assessments, targets, and measures related to ESG become integrated parts of goal \nmanagements, risk assessment, and the way we do business. \nWe Care \nElectri\ufb01cation is the single most important measure to limit man-made climate change. Many sectors have to \nchange their energy use, and we are working on what we believe is one of the most important. Electri\ufb01cation \ngives us the opportunity to reduce this \ufb01gure to zero.  \nYes, we are a company that operates in a market economy and works to make money. But we also care about \nthe consequences of what we do every day when we go to work. We care about making a di\ufb00erence and contri- \nbuting to a better quality of life, not just for our customers and employees, but for everyone. If we succeed in our \nmission towards zero emissions transport, then we are making the world a better place. \nWe Dare \nIn order to create the rapid changes needed to reach the climate goals, we must all dare to move outside our \ncomfort zones. We need to challenge our perceptions in the hiring process in order to create a brilliant, diverse \nwork force that can solve any task an analyze a problem from all perspectives. At Recharge, we work to up-\nhold diversity and non-discriminatory principles across our organization with regards to gender, nationality, age,  \nethnicity, religion, physical disabilities, sexual orientation, and gender identity. We have a goal of a 40 percent \ngender balance by 2025, a goal we are on our way to achieving.  \nWe must break new ground and innovate to create solutions that make it easier for people to make the choices \nthat are best for the climate and the environment. Recharge therefore aims to stay at the forefront of the devel-\nopment of our industry to help make electric vehicles (EVs) the obviously best choice for people who must have \na car. That is why we were the \ufb01rst in Norway with high power charging stations, we were the \ufb01rst to open our \ncharging network to other operators, we were the \ufb01rst with rapid charging corridors between the Nordic capitals, \nand the \ufb01rst with modular load balancing at our high power chargers. We have made improvements to how we \nensure the universal design of our charging stations, ensuring wheelchair accessibility and other adjustments to \nmake the chargers easy to use also for disabled people.  \nDaring to go \ufb01rst is demanding, but it is also enormously rewarding for us to see that we are creating the solutions \nthat enable the development towards emissions-free transport to proceed even faster.   \nWe Share \nNorway is the world\u2019s leading EV nation. Here, everyone can see that EVs in most cases work better than fossil- \nfueled cars, and it is no longer necessary to convince people that EVs are a good choice. Other countries are \nfollowing this trend, and in order to make the changes even faster outside Norway\u2019s borders, we share as much \ninformation as we can about what has made the Norwegian EV adventure possible. With over ten years\u2019 expe-\nrience as a charging operator, we have been part of the development of modern EVs from ", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

This, however, is \nlabour and resource intensive and often backward \nlooking \u2013 thus restricting the speed at which the \nindustry can keep up with investor demand.\nHistorically, ore mainstream ESG policies have focused \non green energy (such as Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures4) but as this moves into \na greater focus on bio-diversity (Taskforce on Nature-\nrelated Financial Disclosures5) it is clear that current \nexclusion policies need to be rewritten.\nSubsidiary and supply chain risks are creating a web \nof complexity as investment strategies pivot away from \ncommercial concerns to a greater focus on ethical and \nmoral grounds.  \n \n2\t Appendix 1\n3\t https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/articles/\nCircular+Economy+ Commission+proposes+new+consumer \n+rights+and+a+band+on+greenwashing+04042022132500\n4\t https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/\n5\t https://tnfd.global/\nFor example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has \nled many global companies to close commercially \nsuccessful operations in Russia.  \nThis complexity is increasing further as more \nESG strategies become aligned with Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) such as \u201czero hunger\u201d \n(SDG #2), \u201cquality education\u201d (SDG #4), as well as \n\u201cresponsible consumption and production\u201d (SDG #12).6 \nThese are harder concepts to measure and more \nsubjective. \nAs an ever-increasing number of economic sectors \nand geographical assets become caught up in a \nless favourable perception, liquidity risk and portfolio \nconcentration may create unnecessary volatility, which \ncan even lead to further de-investment in stressed \nmarket conditions. \nConsequentially, ESG as an investment strategy is \nbecoming unwieldly to manage, particularly for global \ndiverse portfolios with hundreds of names.\n6\t https://sdgs.un.org/goals\nRedefining Value in ESG: The Myriad of Paths to the Summit\n3\n\nThe Data Required to Reassess Risk \nUltimately for investors, what matters most is the \nsust", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Oltre ai risultati di \ngestione ambientale gi\u00e0 raggiunti negli esercizi precedenti con la \ncertificazione ISO 14001 di tutti i siti produttivi, nel 2022 la \ncertificazione ISO 45001 (avviata nel 2021) \u00e8 stato estesa con \nsuccesso anche al sito di Catania e, nel campo della certificazione \ndi prodotto, abbiamo ottenuto la Dichiarazione Ambientale EPD per \nla nostra gamma Margaritelli Road Safety, che dimostra quanto i \nnostri guardrail grazie all\u2019uso del legno siano molto pi\u00f9 performanti \nin termini di GWP dei convenzionali guardrail in acciaio zincato.\nNel 2022, la gestione ambientale si caratterizza per una riduzione \ndella spesa corrente (-16%), dovuta ad una maturazione dei \nprocessi gestionali e quindi ad un loro  efficientamento, ma anche \nper un significativo aumento degli investimenti (+153%), dovuto \nprincipalmente al programma di installazione del fotovoltaico. La \ngestione a favore di Salute e Sicurezza nei luoghi di lavoro, \u00e8 \ncaratterizzata da una spesa per investimenti in linea con l\u2019anno \nprecedente ed una spesa corrente che, per effetto della \nstabilizzazione dei processi gestionali e quindi di un loro  \nefficientamento, \u00e8 tornata sui livelli del 2020.\nNel corso del 2022, dal confronto diretto con diversi nostri \nstakeholder (clienti, Fornitori, progettisti, .. ) sulla tematica della \ndecarbonizzazione e della riduzione della Carbon Foot Print dei \nnostri prodotti, siamo diventati ancora pi\u00f9 consapevoli e convinti di \nquale sia il nostro ruolo nel contrasto al cambiamento climatico, e \nquindi di quanto forte e concreto debba essere l\u2019impegno verso \nl\u2019obiettivo di lungo termine della Neutralit\u00e0 Carbonica.\nProprio in questa prospettiva, gi\u00e0 nel 2022 abbiamo avuto una \nsignificativa diminuzione delle emissioni di Gas Effetto Serra, \nresponsabili del cambiamento climatico, come primo frutto delle \npolitiche di decarbonizzazione che la nostra azienda ha deciso di \nintraprendere. La riduzione di emissioni GHG \u00e8 quindi da attribuire \nall\u2019efficacia delle misure di risparmio energetico attuate nel 2022, \nche hanno consentito una significativa riduzione dei consumi a \nfronte di livelli produttivi sostanzialmente invariati, ma anche \nall\u2019aumento della quota di energia autoprodotta da fonti rinnovabili \n(fotovoltaico), grazie agli impianti fotovoltaici istallati nel sito di \nRodallo (TO) che nel 2022 hanno prodotto a pieno regime. In \nquest\u2019ottica, nel corso del 2023 \u00e8 previsto l\u2019avviamento degli \nimpianti fotovoltaici da 536 kWp di Catania e da 1.039 kWp di \nRodallo.\nInoltre, lo spostamento del trasporto di traverse ferroviarie dalla \nstrada alla rotaia, dove \u00e8 stato possibile attuarlo, come nei \nprecedenti esercizi ha continuato a dare un significativo contributo \nalla riduzione delle emissioni di GHG di scopo 3.\nNel 2022 i rifiuti prodotti sono stati -35% rispetto all\u2019anno \nprecedente, con un volume in leggera crescita di quelli pericolosi \ned un tasso di recupero/riciclo sostanzialmente invariato, mentre i \nconsumi idrici si sono ridotti del -30%.\nIn tema di prevenzione e protezione da infortuni sui luoghi di \nlavoro, sia l\u2019indice di frequenza (IF) che l\u2019indice di gravit\u00e0 (IG) \ndell\u2019organizzazione nel 2022 sono tornati a decrescere, questo \nanche grazie al maggiore impegno economico in formazione e \ninformazione (+36%) per la crescita professionale e la \nsensibilizzazione dei nostri collaboratori.\nI risultati economici della gestione 2022 hanno permesso di \nmantenere invariato il livello occupazionale ed il livello di \nstabilizzazione dell\u2019occupazione del nostro personale rispetto \nall\u2019anno precedente.

These activities \nensure that saying \u201ctomorrow will be better\u201d doesn\u2019t remain a beautiful \nintent, an inflated slogan, or greenwashing.\nFor us, sustainability means producing steel, rethinking industrial \nprocesses according to more virtuous models, and investing to make them \nhappen.\nIt means working first-hand, above all as a company, to reverse a course \nthat, as it stands, has shown all its inconsistencies, fragility, and risks. \nSustainability is taking action in an increasingly profitable synergy with \nall stakeholders because sharing projects is the key to building the future \ntogether.\nYet it also means balancing the delicate nature of man versus nature in a \nzero-sum game. It enhances our know-how, letting those who look \nsuspiciously at the iron and steel world know the excellent circularity of the \nvalue underlying it. \nIt signifies promoting culture and a more respectful, inclusive, participatory \nmentality which can increase the sense of belonging to the cause of \nsustainability. Hence, without exception, we all feel called to act in favour \nof the environment. A duty that I feel above all towards the youngest.\nIn 2021, a year marked by the pandemic \nemergency, we have given concreteness to these \nobjectives with various plans and investments, \nsuch as intensifying train transport between all \ngroup factories and managing over 1.1 million \ntons of steel by rail. Another sign of \nmodernization has been the renovation of the \nentire production plant at our Swiss \nheadquarters, which will allow us to increase \nproductivity, significantly improve energy \nefficiency and reduce emissions with the \ninstallation of a new oven in the rolling mill. \nWe\u2019ve also installed new low-emission billet \nheating furnaces in the French and Romanian \nfactories. Additional activities include the \nmapping of the total CO2 contribution of our \nproduction sites and subsequent identification \nof corrective solutions, the optimiza", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Fixler, a former \nsustainability manager at DWS, revealed that the asset \nmanagement firm was promoting its investment fund \nproducts as greener than they actually were. Since then, US \nand German regulators have been investigating DWS and  \nits parent company Deutsche Bank for suspected investment \nfraud stemming from greenwashing \u2013 a first in the sector. \nMeanwhile, in several studies of the Deutsche Bank subsidi-\nary, Greenpeace has managed to identify additional instances \nof greenwashing. All of this suggests that the fraud with \nsustainability promises at DWS might be systematic.\nIn light of these revelations, the present report examines the \nrole played by the DWS senior executive remuneration \nsystem in the greenwashing scandal and its ongoing impact \ntoday. It is based on publicly available data such as annual \nand remuneration reports. This analysis focuses on three \nrecognized principles of sustainability that must be fulfilled \nto pave the way for effective operational implementation of a \ncompany-wide sustainability strategy \u2013 principles which \nDWS itself was involved in developing:\n\u2014\t Company remuneration structures must adhere to  \n\t\nthe principle of proportionality. \n\u2014\t The achievement of sustainability targets must have a  \n\t\nsizeable impact on executive remuneration. \n\u2014\t The relevance and materiality of the sustainability  \n\t\ntargets must be assured.\nThe research conducted by Greenpeace has led to the  \nfollowing findings on the DWS remuneration system: \n\t A review of the proportionality of the DWS remuneration \nsystem has revealed that, given the size of the compa-\nny, the DWS CEO is by far Germany\u2019s best-paid manag-\ner of a listed company. A peer group comparison shows \nthat the salary of the DWS CEO is significantly higher \nthan what is paid for similar positions in the industry, \nand even exceeds the salary of most CEOs of DAX-list-\ned companies. Hence, the company fails to take an \nappropriate approach to top executive salaries as a \nkey means of achieving sustainability goals.\n\t When it comes to weighting sustainability targets in \nexecutive board remuneration, there is ample evidence \nthat environmental, social and governance (ESG) \ncriteria have had a substantial influence on the salaries \nreceived by top management and by the CEO in \nparticular since 2020. The structuring of bonus-relat-\ned sustainability targets has proven to be highly \nproblematic, though, because it gives top manage-\nment massive incentives to pursue systematic \ngreenwashing. The relabeling of funds to meet 2020 \nsustainability goals can be considered as manipula-\ntion. This questionable approach enabled former CEO \nAsoka W\u00f6hrmann to receive higher bonuses.\n\t By all appearance, this massive perverse incentive has \nnow been recognized. In the Compensation Report \n2021, the problematic goal of \u201cESG-specific assets \nunder management\u201d has been removed from the \nperformance targets for the C", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Accordingly, we have made progress \nin placing our products and services within reach \nof individuals, thereby boosting their quality of \nlife. For example, RedSalud has implemented new \ntelemedicine alternatives like online testing, while \nVida C\u00e1mara launched \u201c5-50,\u201d a product aimed at \nSMEs with five to 50 employees who previously \ncould not access supplemental health insurance. \nOne of the key challenges we have set for ourselves \nis to get to know our customers better so that, in \nturn, we are able to better serve their needs.  In this \nspirit, Confuturo has enabled online tools such as \nthe Online Advisor, a virtual guide available to assist \nusers with their pensions and life annuities. \nBut we believe that we must take this further\u2014beyond \nour customers\u2014which is why we have revamped \nour programs to have an impact on the community \nas a whole. RedSalud spearheaded a series of \nregional initiatives, by providing access to testing \nand preventative screenings in several communities. \nConsalud continues to host family sporting events \nsuch as the Recreational Bike Path in Santiago and \nthe Vi\u00f1a del Mar Marathon. Moreover, our subsidiaries \nhave partnered with various organizations, such as \nLas Rosas Foundation, Esperanza Shelter, Sofofa\u2019s \nNetwork of Inclusive Companies (REIN), and \nothers, to manage donations to vulnerable groups. \nLikewise, we must not forget that proceeds from our \noperations are allocated to funding social projects \nin the construction industry. In 2019, our majority \nshareholder, Chilean Chamber of Construction, invested \nUS$19 million in projects benefiting construction \nworkers and their families. Most of these projects \nwere financed through ILC dividends.  \nOur second strategic pillar is centered on fostering a \nculture of service and ethics among all team members. \nIn order for our employees to provide good services, \nthey must be motivated and trained; we also make \nan effort to instill our dedication to inclusiveness \nthroughout the entire organization. One example is \nour commitment to promoting female employees: \nwomen account for 73% of our total workforce and \n65% of new hires, not to mention that for the first \ntime ever a woman sits on our Board of Directors.  \nIn addition, we have reinforced ethical aspects of \nour operations. In 2019, ILC adjusted and certified \nits Crime Prevention Model to broaden the scope \nto include new crimes that could have an impact \non the Company (Law 21,121).

As we continued \nto face unprecedented challenges in \n2021, our mission to deliver value to \nour Customers never wavered. Our \nsuccess in the face of uncertainty and \nunpredictability comes in part from our \nflexible business model, but mainly \nfrom the dedication, hard work, and \nperseverance of our nearly 100,000 \nAssociates in our Stores, Distribution \nCenters, and Buying and Corporate \nOffices. To all of them, I am grateful. \nIn this fiscal year 2021 report, you will \nlearn more about our ongoing efforts, \nwith an emphasis on empowering our \nAssociates, supporting our communities, \noperating sustainably, and conducting \nbusiness ethically. \nWe take pride in these pursuits while \nlearning and adapting. We consistently \npush ourselves to evaluate best \npractices to evolve our business and \nhelp create a more inclusive and \nsustainable future. We continue to make \nadvancements in our own organization, \nbut we know there is much more work to \nbe done and will always remain focused \non a better tomorrow. \nAs a Company, we value our differences \nand diversity. We work to treat everyone \nwith dignity and respect, and provide \nopportunities for our Associates to grow \nand succeed. To support this, we have \ndeveloped more partnerships to help \nrecruit and retain a diverse workforce, \nexpanded our employee resource \ngroups, and increased our education \nand training offerings. We are continuing \nto invest in our Associates with valued \nbenefits and rewards, including \nprograms that assist with physical, \nemotional, and financial wellness. We \nalso provide education scholarships for \nour Associates and their dependents, \nvolunteer opportunities, and corporate \nmatching of charitable giving.  \nWhile we are dedicated to being a great \nplace to work, we are also helping to \nstrengthen the communities where our \nAssociates and Customers live. We have \nexpanded our philanthropic efforts through \nour Company and our Foundation with \nseveral initiatives and grant programs to \nhelp create a brighter future for today\u2019s \nyouth. Our giving also includes our ongoing \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nsocial injustice, and natural disasters that \nimpacted our homes and livelihoods. \nWe continue to take meaningful actions \nto reduce our impact on the environment \nand improve the efficiency and the \nsustainability of our operations. For more \nthan 20 years, we have sought out ways \nto use less energy and fewer natural \nresources. We are very proud to build \non our momentum and announce our \nambition to be at net-zero greenhouse gas \nemissions by 2050 or sooner, in adherence \nto the Paris Climate Agreement.

This is just one of the \naspects of our business that are relevant \nfrom a CSR point of view.\nFor SOLUTIONS 30, Sustainability starts with \ncustomer satisfaction and develops through \na strategy of profitable and continuous \ngrowth designed to increase our ability to \nmanage and maximise our own non-financial \nrisks.\nSustainability applies not only to what we \ndo, but also to how we do it.

This will be published in the first quarter of \n2023 for fiscal 2022.  \nSustainability Management  \nBusiness Model \nSartorius operates in the life science sector \u2013 more precisely, in the field of medical biotechnology. As a partner \nto the biopharmaceutical industry, the Group manufactures products and process technologies that are used \nin the development and production of biological medicines and vaccines. In this context, the Group places a \nparticular focus on innovations that make it possible to increase the safety, speed, and efficiency of the \ndevelopment and production process for such active ingredients. This allows new therapies to be made \navailable to patients earlier, at lower prices, and to a larger number of patients.  \nFor further information on the Group\u2019s business model, strategy, and objectives, please refer to the section \n\u201cBusiness Model, Strategy, and Goals\u201d on page 26 et seq. of this Annual Report.  \nAmbition and Strategic Sustainability Topics \nAs a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, the Group is committed to complying with certain social \nand environmental standards when conducting its business activities.

We define stakeholders as \nthose individuals, companies, institutions, and interest groups that are able to influence the success of the \nSartorius Group or are affected by the company\u2019s activities.

With our technologies, we \nhelp researchers and engineers achieve faster, easier progress in the life sciences and bioprocess technology, \nthus enabling the development of new and better treatments and vaccines and affordable medical care. \nMany people in industrialized countries suffer from diseases for which there is as yet no effective treatment. \nThese include cancer, dementia and autoimmune diseases as well as congenital metabolic disorders and \ninfectious diseases. At the same time, many diseases that would have proved fatal just a few generations ago \ncan now be cured or treated effectively. Combined with declining birth rates, this has led to an aging society \nin industrialized countries where people are expected to remain fit and healthy for as long as possible. \nIn developing and emerging countries, the availability and affordability of healthcare is well below the \nstandards in industrialized nations: more than half the world\u2019s population has either no or inadequate access \nto medical care. For every second child, initial immunization is an unachievable goal, and it is estimated that \n1.5million children under the age of five die from diseases from which they could be protected with \nvaccinations. \nThe purpose of our business is to help our customers develop and manufacture biotechnology-based drugs \nand vaccines and, in doing so, enable the development and safe production of vaccines and \nbiopharmaceutical medicines to treat serious and, in some cases, rare diseases. The United Nations\u2019 \nsustainability goal \u2018Good Health and Well-Being\u2019 is thus an integral part of our core business. \nAs a 150-year old company, sustainability is firmly embedded at many levels in our business. To us, it means \noperating responsibly over the long term \u2013 with respect to customers, employees, investors, business partners \nand society as a whole. Likewise, it entails handling natural resources responsibly. Sustainable action also \nmeans remaining agile and constantly asking ourselves how we can respond to the changing world and make \na positive contribution. This concerns the continued development of our core business just as much as living \nup to our corporate responsibilities. \nBecause of the Covid-19 pandemic, 2020 was characterized by changes that posed serious challenges for \nsociety as a whole. At the same time, the crisis showed how Sartorius\u2019 core business makes a direct contribution \ntowards the goal of \u201chealthy lives and well-being for all at all ages\u201d: with its products and process knowledge, \nSartorius is involved in many of the worldwide vaccine projects to combat the coronavirus. \nOptimization of processes and methods throughout the entire supply chain can also make a contribution \ntowards sustainability \u2013 this mainly includes the consideration of sustainability in procurement, product \ndevelopment and production. Our product portfolio includes consumables such as filters, pipette tips, cell \nculture media and bags. These sterile products for use in biopharmaceutical research and development have \nsignificant benefits compared to reusable products. Nevertheless, we see potential to reduce our use of \nnatural resources in this area. \nIn this connection, Sartorius signed the European Plastics Pact in 2020 as the first company in its industry. The \naim of this public-private initiative is to improve the use and recycling of plastics and, as a consequence, use \nless virgin plastic. With cross-border cooperation agreements on a European level, the signatories want  \nto develop new technologies, share their findings, harmonize guidelines and standards and dismantle  \nexisting barriers. \n\nSartorius\nCombined Group Management Report\nResponsibility at Sartorius\n123\nStart\nSartorius\u2019 CO2 emissions are relatively low, since the company is not a high energy user nor does it purchase \nenergy-intensive raw materials. However, we do believe it is important that we play our part in helping to \nreduce global warming. To reduce our Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions, we set ourselves science-based targets \nin the reporting year, which are based on the science-based targets and the 1.5\u00b0C goal. \nThis year, our Corpo", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

In response to these risks and to take the necessary \nsteps to mitigate them, the world\u2019s governments have \ndecided to make a concerted effort to limit the progressive \nrise in temperatures and to mitigate the effects of climate \nchange. As a consequence of these efforts, expectations \nhave risen for the private sector committed to the climate \ntransition through tightening regulation.\nIn December 2015, 197 countries signed the Paris \nAgreement, an international agreement that aims to limit \nthe increase in global average temperature to well below \n2\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels and aims to maintain \nan increase of only 1.5\u00b0C. The structure of the Paris \nAgreement consists of legally binding targets for limiting \nthe increase in the Earth\u2019s average temperature, as well as \nthe obligations of the parties to the agreement, of which \nthe contributions of individual countries are the most \nimportant. Underpinning the broad climate action is \nthe assumption that halting the rise in global temperatures \nwill require significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions on a global scale. While the responsibility \nfor achieving the agreement\u2019s goals rests with national \ngovernments and drives changes in the area of development \npolicies (e.g. the European Green Deal package), the Pari", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 5957.1}}}}

I also feel \ngood about the resources we have dedicated to \nsustainability \u2013 a crucial part of an ambitious \napproach to sustainability. Not only do we have a \nteam within the investment team that takes \nleadership on sustainability issues, but we also have \nextensive resources to draw on through our close \ncollaboration with the rest of SEB and can access \ndeep ESG expertise to the benefit of our investors \nand portfolio companies.\nI\u2019m also happy with the impressive work of our \nportfolio companies. In 2022, we had our first \nportfolio company, Accedo, submit a Science-Based \nTarget. Accedo has taken a very proactive \napproach to sustainability and aims to be a leader in \nsustainability in the media-tech industry, as they see \nthe benefits it has on recruiting and employee \nretention, customer dialogues, and reputation \namong stakeholders. We have also seen several \nother portfolio companies take steps to improve \ntheir governance around sustainability, improve \ntheir data tracking, and set goals and targets for \ntheir sustainability work.\nSFDR level 2 came into force in yearend 2022. \nDuring the spring, we have done an extensive job of \ngathering data on our portfolio companies to assess \ntheir performance on key sustainability metrics. \nThis exercise was carried out a year ago for our \nNordic portfolio, and in this, we have found a good \nworking model for supporting our businesses in \nbetter understanding their environmental and social \nfootprints.\nWhile it is easy to find parts of the SFDR and \nTaxonomy to criticise, we believe the new \nregulation will play an important role in driving \nwider adoption in the financial industry to take \nconcrete steps in the right direction. This is just the \nbeginning of a long journey and I\u2019m optimistic that \nthe early uncertainty and misalignment between \nthe regulation and what really is material to \nbusinesses will converge over time.\nVictor Lang\nCIO and Head of SEB Private Equity\nOpening remarks\nOur commitment to sustainability is \nstronger than ever, and we have taken \nseveral important steps during 2022 \nto raise the bar on sustainability.\n3\n1.

We focus on developing \ncompanies both operationally and \nstrategically by partnering with \nentrepreneurs and managers. By doing so, \nwe have managed to build a highly \nexperienced team with an excellent \nnetwork, and the skills to source \nproprietary investment opportunities and \ncreate long-term investor value.\nWe manage approximately USD 4bn in \ncapital on behalf of clients, and our \nStockholm-based team makes \ninvestments both across the Nordics and \nglobally. Our approach is unique. It is \ndifferent from other private equity firms in \nthat we invest directly in majority-owned \ncompanies in the Nordics, directly \nalongside selected partners globally and \nindirectly through established \npartnerships as primaries and \nsecondaries.

We recognise the role we play in contributing to a sustainable future. The Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change (IPCC) warns that, should global warming reach 1.5\u00b0C in the foreseeable future, it will cause increasing climate \nhazards and present unavoidable risks to all ecosystems and humans.\nAs we said in our Annual Report, we are proud of the progress we have made in our global Environmental, Social and Gover-\nnance (ESG) programme over the last year. It continues to drive positive impacts within SoftwareOne and the communities in \nwhich we operate. We are fully committed to reducing our carbon footprint, conserving resources, and promoting sustainable \npractices throughout our operations.\nWe have identified a set of material risks and areas for improvement across all areas of ESG, which require collaboration from \nacross the many departments in SoftwareOne. We will continue to drive more sustainable outcomes for our clients via techno-\nlogy solutions, while further embedding sustainability in our own operations and across our value chain.\nPeople-centric approach\nSince its launch in 2021, our ESG programme has received unwavering support from our Board of Directors which created a \nnew ad hoc ESG Committee chaired by Isabelle Romy.\nTo strengthen our ESG framework in 2022, employee-driven committees were created under the three ESG topics. These \ncommittees are each chaired by members of the Executive Board; Bernd Schlotter, President of Services, Julia Braun, Chief \nHuman Resources Officer and Frank Rossini, Chief Legal Officer.\nInnovative strategy\nSoftwareOne has a unique opportunity to leverage our core expertise and market-leading technologies in our approach to our \nESG strategy. In 2022, SoftwareOne made significant headway in calculating our carbon footprint to use as a baseline for our \nstrategies on emission reduction and avoidance. We obtained internal support to create a global Diversity Equity Inclusion and \nBelonging  strategy and moved forward in incorporating ESG into our third-party risk management strategies.\nPartnering for the Future\nAddressing ESG challenges requires long-term collaboration and continuous innovation. Effective actions that limit global \nwarming could substantially reduce projected losses and damages in human systems and ecosystems, which is why our call to \naction goes beyond compliance with regulations. It is about embracing a mindset of innovation and collaboration. In this report, \nwe have set ambitious targets to further reduce our environmental impact, enhance social inclusivity and diversity, and streng-\nthen our overall governance practices. We recognise that it is only though our client partnerships, employee passion and total \nbuy in that together we can make an impact that will benefit our planet and our people.\n \nBrian Duffy, CEO\nA letter from our CEO\nBrian Duffy \nCEO\nwww.softwareone.com\n4\nSoftwareOne ESG Report 2022\nOur Purpose\n\nAbout us\nSoftwareOne is a leading global software and cloud solutions provider with over 9,000 employees.

Nissan is responding to these developments \nby focusing on electrification and other innovative technologies and by \npromoting decarbonization through reductions in CO2 emissions throughout \nthe value chain, including by suppliers.\nNissan\u2019s Steps to Reduce CO2 Emissions\nThe business structure of the automobile industry is changing greatly in \nthe face of demands to reduce CO2 emissions and dependence on fossil \nfuels. As a global automaker, Nissan considers emissions across the entire \nvalue chain it shares with its suppliers, from procurement of raw materials \nto transportation and operation of vehicles. We understand how important it \nis to balance environmental initiatives with business activities, and strive to \nreduce emissions through new technology development, renewable energy \nuse and other measures.\nGRI103-1  GRI103-2\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nNISSAN MOTOR CORPORATION\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020\nEnvironmental\nCEO Message\nSocial\nCSO Message\nGovernance\nCorporate Purpose /\nESG Highlights\nESG Data\nSustainability at Nissan\nEditorial Policy\nNissan's Contribution \nto the SDGs\nGRI Content Index\nThe Alliance\nQuick Guide For Investors\n057\nContents\nEnvironmental\nEfforts at Every Link in the Value Chain\nThe Nissan Green Program 2022 (NGP2022) aims to achieve carbon \nneutrality by reducing emissions from our corporate activities, products and \nservices.\nCO2 Emissions in the Value Chain*\nSuppliers\n19.520\nmillion tons\nReducing CO2 emissions from corporate activities\nProduction\n2.610\nmillion tons\nLogistics\n1.483\nmillion tons\nVehicle usage\n180.880\nmillion tons\nOf\ufb01ces,\ndealerships\n0.619\nmillion tons\nRecycling\nReducing CO2 emissions from products and service\n* Actual emissions in 2018.\nBuilding a Resilient Climate Change Strategy\nThe incremental move toward decarbonization could generate major new \nrisks for businesses. In addition to transition risks resulting from changes in \npolicies and regulations, technologies, markets and reputation, there are also \ngrowing physical risks, as climate change raises the frequency of extreme \nweather conditions. Recognizing climate change as a risk for the financial \nsystem, the G20 Financial Stability Board established the Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to encourage disclosures \nthat would enable investors to make informed decisions. In its June 2017 \nfinal report, the Task Force proposed a recommendations framework for \ninformation disclosure.\nNissan considers climate change to be an issue that goes to the heart of its \noperations. The Global Environmental Management Committee (G-EMC), \nco-chaired by a board member, identifies trends in climate-related risks and \nbusiness opportunities and adopts strategies accordingly. Climate change \nand other environmental risks comprise a category of risks for corporate \nmanagement and are regularly monitored by the Internal Control Committee \nto strengthen corporate governance.\nWe analyze climate-related risks on an ongoing basis, and have specified \nas major risks tighter regulations on fuel economy and CO2 emissions, \nintensifying competition in the EV market and physical damage due to \nextreme weather conditions. We determine specific measures to be taken \nby each division after clarifying the risks and opportunities\u0336including those \nrelating to climate change\u0336for our company.\nAdditionally, climate change also greatly heightens customer needs for \nenergy-efficient mobility.

With the pandemic persisting in shaping our new \nnormal, unstable widespread macro-economic trends and challenging times in the luxury market, \nat Sergio Rossi we faced these unexpected circumstances with great e\ufb00orts and remained true to \nour DNA with a further step in innovation investments. Moreover, as the CEO, I am pleased to see \nhow uni\ufb01ed our Group has been throughout the past two years. \nOur focus was placed not only in shaping original and unique high-fashion footwears for our \ncustomers, but also on ensuring that our employees' needs were looked after. As a cohesive \nGroup, we successfully overcame the di\ufb03culties guided by our long-term commitment towards \nsustainability, that foresees a great attention to the environment we live in, the people involved in \nour activities and the local communities around us.\nAs anticipated last year, as of 2021, we are glad to be a part of the Lanvin Group (formerly Fosun \nFashion Group) and this exciting new partnership with an international luxury fashion group is \nset to increase our brand's global reputation and to present us with interesting new opportunities. \nMoreover, since the Lanvin Group is headquartered in China, we will be looking to expand further \nour presence in Asia, one of our most important markets. Grateful for this new journey, we look \nahead optimistically with a great enthusiasm to start new challenges. \nDespite the di\ufb03cult context, we never forwent our responsibilities towards the environment. \nWe continued purchasing certi\ufb01ed renewable energy and are proud to announce that, as of 2021, \n100% of electricity purchased for our factory and all our Italian stores comes from renewable \nsources. In addition, thanks also to our in-house photovoltaic system, we were able to avoid more \nthan 1,200 tonnes of CO2. \nAll our women and men are the core of the success of our company. Our artisans' love and dedication \nto every shoe we make highlights our passion, which has always distinguished our brand, heritage \nand know-how. We believe in our people, enhancing their technical skills and knowledge and \npromoting long lasting relationships. In fact, as of 2021, I am honoured to say that 63% of our \ntechnicians and artisans have been with us for more than 10 years. This incredible achievement, \ntogether with the introduction of a generation of new artisans, further reduction in work-related \ninjuries, underlines the way we take care of our people and the future of the company. \nLastly, another point on which we focus our attention are local communities. Since our inception, \nour beloved founder Sergio Rossi has always understood the importance of our roots and the \nartistic craftsmanship of the Italian style. The passion for our daily work encourages us to \ncelebrate the Artisanal Maestria that distinguishes our creations: as a result, we periodically \ncollect historical models, documents and drawings from all over the world to extend our Living \nHeritage Archive with the aim to promote, perpetuate and disseminate our roots. Furthermore, \nwe contribute to the prosperity and the development of our surrounding areas preferring Italian \nsuppliers (95%), the 22% of which is located in Emilia Romagna.  \nAt Sergio Rossi, we believe sustainability goes beyond our reporting commitment. In addition \nto the attention we place in annually reporting our environmental, social and economic \nperformances, we are also dedicated to adhering to two international voluntary frameworks \nsponsored by the United Nations, the Global Compact (UNGC) and the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs). On the one hand, we joined the UNGC community of 14,000 companies and 4,000 \nnon-business, becoming participant since 2017 and maintaining our responsibilities towards it to \nthis day. On the other hand, understanding the importance that Sustainable Development Goals \nplay in driving business awareness and actions, we have pledged to tackle a series of them to the \nbest of our abilities.\nIn looking at Sergio Rossi's future with excitement, we are con\ufb01dent that through boldness and \ninnovation, we will contin", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

These \nchallenges serve as a stark reminder of our call to action for \nsecuring a \u2018sustainable future.\u2019\nIn this context, we drastically strengthened our sustainability \ngovernance to highlight that \u2018sustainability\u2019 remains our top \npriority in our business operations and to embed this priority in \nevery aspect of the organization.\nIn addition to establishing the Sustainability Management \nOffice within each business unit and elevating the existing \ncompany-wide function as the Corporate Sustainability Center, \nwe expanded the Governance Committee under the Board of \nDirectors as the Sustainability Committee in 2021 to reinforce the \nBoard\u2019s oversight of sustainability activities.

The aftermath of the \ncorona pandemic, the tense geopolitical situation as \nwell as Russia-Ukraine conflict and the resulting sanc\u00ad\ntions caused bottlenecks in the supply of energy and \nraw materials, significant price increases and high infla\u00ad\ntion. In this extraordinary and difficult situation, the \nSemperit Group demonstrated its robustness and agility.\nThe signing of the divestment of Sempermed to HARPS \nGLOBAL PTE LTD at the end of December 2022 was an \nimportant milestone for our company, as it enables us \nto push ahead with our orientation as an industrial \npolymer specialist in addition to implementing the \nsegment sale. As part of the ongoing transformation \nprocess, Semperit is not only striving for further organic \nand inorganic growth, but at the same time also for \nmajor steps in operational sustainability. We are aware \nthat this will not be an easy undertaking for a rubber \nprocessing company in the chemical industry. Never\u00ad\ntheless, we are convinced that we can achieve the goal, \nwith a transparent ESG portfolio that has a noticeable \npositive impact on all three areas: environmental, social \nand governance.\nIt was with pleasure and pride that we accepted the \n\u201cAustria\u2019s Leading Companies Award\u201d in the category \n\u201dSustainability\u201d in listed companies in Austria for 2022. \nThe award in the area of sustainability was well \ndeserved: we worked hard over the past five years to \nachieve this quality level in sustainability and the corre\u00ad\nsponding reporting. We consciously and purposefully \nset the bar high in our reporting quality and will \ncontinue to make this demand on ourselves in the \nfuture in the highly complex regulatory environment. \nFOREWORD FROM THE \nEXECUTIVE BOARD\nIT IS IMPORTANT TO \nANCHOR SUSTAINABILITY \nNOT ONLY IN ALL AREAS \nOF THE COMPANY, BUT \nALSO IN THE HEARTS AND \nMINDS OF OUR EMPLOYEES.\nSEMPERIT | SUSTAINABILIT Y REPORT 2022\n4\n\nThe coming months will be no less intense than the \npast year. External and internal factors such as the \ncurrent supply chain and logistics issues, geopolitical \ntensions, but also the planned company growth will \ncontinue to keep us very busy.

The first of its kind \nfor our business, this report highlighted our history of environmental \ncompliance, health and safety performance, and robust ethics. It \nmarked a shift in how we defined sustainability; it reinforced our \nsense of accountability and allowed us to recognize that we had \nroom for cultural growth in order to embrace larger sustainability \nconcepts. Through this exercise, we also acknowledged that better \ndata collection was required in order to establish a strategy and \nset measurable goals for success. \nThe years that followed allowed Stella-Jones to continue to learn, \nwork hard and strive to do better for our people and our planet. \nThese sustained efforts paved the way for a number of initiatives \nand learnings that have served us well and brought us to this next \nchapter in our ESG story.\nConnecting Our Sustainable Future\nPivotal to our 2022 ESG report is the unveiling of our ESG Strategy, \ntitled \u2018Connecting our Sustainable Future\u2019, anchored in measurable \ngoals across our six key topics of Climate Change & Greenhouse \nGas (\u201cGHG\u201d) Emissions, Health and Safety, Our People, Indigenous \nPeoples, Responsible Supply Chain and ESG Risk", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

This is our first \nSustainability Report\nIt is with great pleasure that I present to you our first \nSustainability Report. I see its publication as another \nkey milestone on our new path to sustainability. \nTogether with the new owners and our employees, \nwe have laid a solid foundation for a completely new \ndirection for the GasNet Group.\nBecause a shared future is what matters to us, ESG \n(Environmental, Social, Governance) forms the very \nbasis of our new strategy. We care about how we treat \neach other, our communities and the environment. We \ncare about our health and the health of our society. \nAnd that\u2019s why the only thing that gives us purpose \nis to do business in a sustainable, responsible and \nconsiderate way. Let me tell you the story of our \nSustainability Report.\nIt is divided into four main chapters representing \nthe four pillars of our ESG approach which clearly \ncapture our policies, commitments, activities, projects \nand achievements in each area. We want to be as \ntransparent as possible; we want to be open, and \nwe comply with international standards. We are \ncommitted to the UN Sustainable Development Goals \n\u2013 so at the end of each chapter you will find a brief \noverview of everything we have done to meet these \ngoals in 2020. \nWe take ESG seriously. And we do it well. This has also \nbeen confirmed by the independent rating agency \nSustainalytics, a global leader in ESG company ratings. \nAn in-depth audit and a peer benchmark with other \ncompanies in the gas industry has given a clear result: \nthe GasNet score of 19.4 (Low Risk) places it among \nthe industry leaders (strong ESG management). \nYet we are still at the beginning and there are still \nmany challenges on the horizon. The European \nenergy sector is undergoing a fundamental change. \nThe Paris Agreement and the Green Deal for Europe \nset ambitious targets. Europe wants to reduce net \ncarbon dioxide emissions to zero and be climate \nneutral by 2050. As the domestic leader in natural gas \ndistribution, we are aware of our responsibility and are \ncommitted to playing a key role in the transformation \nof the Czech energy sector. We are convinced that, \nespecially in the context of the Czech Republic, \ndecarbonisation is not possible without natural gas \n\u2013 especially in road transport and in the heating \nsector, where it will be the only real and affordable \nreplacement for coal which is on its way out. New and \nrenewable gases such as biomethane or hydrogen will \nbecome increasingly important in the years to come. \nWe are already actively preparing for this today. We \nwelcome green energy and want to be a strong part of it.\nWe, however, see our contribution to a shared future in \na broader context: supporting communities, diversity, \nchildren and their potential, working with schools, \ndeveloping the skills of our employees, looking after \ntheir health and much more. \nThe year 2020 brought many great successes as well \nas challenges. Following the spin-off from the innogy \nGroup, we have succeeded in laying a solid foundation \nfor the already independent GasNet Group. Together, \nwe embarked on a new journey \u2013 with a new brand, \na\u00a0new corporate culture and a sustainable approach to \nour business.

We need to accelerate the transition towards new energy, \nimprove energy conversion efficiency with greater determination and \ncourage, so as to deal with climate change more professionally. \nSungrow always takes \u201cClean power for all\u201d as the mission of our \nbusiness, and is constantly committed to the research, development, \npromotion and application of clean energy conversion technologies. As \na responsible corporate citizen, we added a new topic on climate change \nin this year\u2019s report and disclosed the company's action plan to deal with \nclimate change. We have joined RE100. By constructing our own new \nenergy power plants, installing rooftop photovoltaic system in factories \nand engaging in green card transactions, we tried to increase the \nproportion of green energy use at an annual rate of 10% with the hope of \ncovering the use of green electricity in production and operation by 2028. \nWith the introduction of ISO14064 and 14067 standards, we have taken \nseveral measures to quantize the carbon emissions such as carrying out \ncarbon inventory and carbon footprint accounting. We have gradually \nestablished a scientific system for carbon emission management, and \npromoted the implementation of various emission and carbon reduction \nmeasures.\nIn the past year, Sungrow has strengthened ESG management, \ncontinued to improve the corporate governance system. Its increasing \nrevenue has brought more returns for shareholders. We continuously \noptimized the quality management system, promoted product and \ntechnology innovation, and responded quickly to meet customers\u2019 \nservice demands. We increased investment in safety production to \nprotect employees' occupational health and safety, accelerated the \ntraining of international talents, and promoted employees' dual-channel \ncareer development. We actively assumed the primary responsibilities of \nfighting against epidemic and promoting production resumption, aided in \nthe construction of Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital, helped partners \nachieve work and production resump", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

We are fighting this battle as the \nsole power generator fighting openly for an energy \nsector free from subsidies, a sector in which the \ncompetition provides the motivation for bringing the \nprice of energy down and freeing consumers who are \ncurrently hostages of a model driven by high inflation, \nthat drains incomes and limits the dreams of millions \nof Brazilians. As such, in 2021, we decided to assume \nthe role of protagonist, by publicly and transparently \ndefending regulatory changes that will allow Brazil\u2019s \nenergy (the cleanest and most affordable in the world) \nto achieve its full potential. Amongst the affirmative \nactions being adopted, we are contributing to the \napproval of a law that takes into consideration the \ninterests of society as a whole, establishing the new \nregulatory framework for Distributed Generation \n(DG), bringing an end to subsidies over the coming \nyears, which will save energy consumers billions of \nReais. We have also launched the \u2018Movimento Luz \nLivre\u2019 (\u2018Free Light Movement\u2019 - \u2018MLL\u2019), in support of \nthe approval of Bill of Law 414/21 by the Federal \nLegislative Authority, meaning that approximately \n50 million consumers will be able to choose who \nthey purchase their power from, just as they can \nchoose their cellular phone operator or bank. \nDriven by the desire to transform the country \nthrough clean and affordable electricity, and long \nbefore the term \u2018ESG\u2019 started to be used, the \npositive experience of 2021 was another step on \na journey in which we will continue to defend just \ncauses, since we undoubtedly wish to establish \nour position and become increasingly recognized \nas a company providing a service to society.\nAt the end of 2021, we brought together our three \nbusiness fronts - development, generation and \ncommercialization - under the \u2018Omega Energia\u2019 holding \ncompany, which came to be listed on the B3  \u2018Novo \nMercado\u2019 or \u2018New Market\u2019 (\u2018MEGA3\u2019) In the words of \none investor which is a global benchmark in ESG, \nthis operation demonstrated \u201cthe importance that \nOmega places on good governance and dialog with \nits minority shareholders,\u201d given that the operation \nwas decided upon exclusively by independent board \nmembers and shareholders with no conflicting \ninterests, which is not a very common practice \nin the Brazilian market.

Ukraine's lower \nproduction levels contributed in part to this \nresult. Thanks to higher production efficiency \nthan 2021, we avoided approximately 546 \nthousand tonnes of CO2.\nIn June 2022, we presented our roadmap, \n\u201cOur Journey to Net Zero\u201d. At the event, \nattended by a large number of national and \ninternational stakeholders, we explained \nin detail the path and conditions to achieve \ncarbon neutrality by 2050. To give more \nimpetus and credibility to our roadmap, we \nhave also defined an intermediate target \nfor 2030. This was recently validated by the \nSBTi (Science Based Target initiative), an \nauthoritative, independent, international \nbody, which has certified its compatibility \nwith the goals set by the 2015 Paris \nAgreement. \nThe year 2022 was also the deadline we had \nset for achieving important sustainability \ntargets that had been announced in 2017:\n\u2022\t a 5% reduction in our specific CO2 emissions \ncompared to 2017;\n\u2022\t the implementation of structural \nengagement projects in all our production \nsites with a high economic, environmental \nand social impact;\n\u2022\t the achievement of increasingly safe \nworking conditions.\nIt is with pride and satisfaction that we can \nconfirm that all the above goals have been \nachieved!\nFor this reason, we wish to thank everyone \nwho has contributed to this achievement \nthrough their tremendous determination and \nprofessionalism. \nWe are aware, however, that we still have a \nlong way to go.

The intent is to replicate \nthat growth in the public bond markets. The Principles aim to provide issuers \nwith guidance on how best to issue an SLB whilst ensuring that investors are \nprovided with adequate information. At the same time, the Principles look to \nassist underwriters by moving the market towards standardised approaches to \nstructuring and disclosure. \nWe take a look at the basics of the Principles and how they might be used. In \naddition, we discuss some of the points issuers and underwriters should \nconsider when bringing this product to market. \nThe basics \nThe Principles have five core components:  \n1. Selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  \nAs a first step, an issuer will need to select the KPI (or KPIs) it wants to use. \nThe Principles note the importance of the selected KPIs being \"credible\". That \nis KPIs should be \"material to the issuer\u2019s core sustainability and business \nstrategy and address relevant environmental, social and/or governance \nchallenges of the industry sector and be under management\u2019s control\".  \nIn addition, KPIs should be:  \n\u2022 \nrelevant, core and material to the issuer\u2019s overall business, and of \nhigh strategic significance to the issuer\u2019s current and/or future \noperations;  \n\u2022 \nmeasurable or quantifiable on a consistent methodological basis;  \n \n1 Bloomberg New Energy Finance \nKey issues \n\u2022 \nSustainability-linked loans are \nnow a mainstream product. The \naim is that SLBs will be too \n\u2022 \n5 core components \u2013 credible \nKey Performance Indicators \n(KPIs), ambitious Sustainability \nPerformance Targets (SPTs), \nmeaningful changes in bond \ncharacteristics, verification and \nreporting \n\u2022 \nMay be particularly useful for \nissuers that want to demonstrate \nESG commitments but are less \nable to issue a \"use of proceeds\" \nbond \n\u2022 \nCareful consideration of \ndisclosure, drafting and \nsustainability impact will be \nessential  \n\u2022 \nPart of a growing trend for new \ncapital markets products in \nsustainable finance, such as \ntransition bonds, ESG labelled \nprogrammes and, soon, the new \nEU Green Bond Standard \n\n  \nSUSTAINABILITY-LINKED BONDS \u2013 MAKING\nSENSE OF SLBS, KPIS AND SPTS\n \n \n2 |  \n June 2020 \n \nClifford Chance \n\u2022 \nexternally verifiable; and  \n\u2022 \nable to be benchmarked using external reference or definitions to \nfacilitate the assessment of the SPT\u2019s level of ambition. \nVarious KPIs have been used in the loan market including greenhouse gas \nemissions, ESG ratings, water and energy consumption, proportion of \nrenewable energy production, carbon footprint, solid waste sent to landfill and \ngender equality measures such as percentage of women in senior \nmanagement roles. The key point is that the KPI should matter not only to the \nissuer's business but also to wider society. \n2. Calibration of Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs)  \nOnce a KPI has been chosen, an appropriate target level needs to be \ncalibrated. The Principles state that SPTs should be \"ambitious\". That is: \n\u2022 \nrepresent a material improvement in the respective KPIs and be \nbeyond a \u201cBusiness as Usual\u201d trajectory; \n\u2022 \nwhere possible be compared to a benchmark or an external \nreference;  \n\u2022 \nbe consistent with the issuers\u2019 overall strategic sustainability/ESG \nstrategy; and \n\u2022 \nbe determined on a predefined timeline, set before (or concurrently \nwith) the issuance of the bond. \nIt is recommended (although not required) that an issuer appoints an external \nreview provider confirming the alignment of the bond with the five core \ncomponents of the Principles. External reviewers are encouraged to disclose \ntheir credentials and relevant expertise and communicate clearly the scope of \nthe review conducted. The Principles point to ICMA's Voluntary Guidelines for \nExternal Reviews which have been developed to promote best practice in this \narea. \n3. Bond characteristics  \nThe defining feature of an SLB is that the financial or structural characteristics \nof the bond vary depending on whether the selected SPT is reached. As \nmentioned above, variation in interest rate is likely to be the most common \nexample but the Principles stress that other structural features could be \nconsidered.

Mobility is among \nthose sectors undergoing one of the most transformational \ntechnological shifts. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the \nimmense potential of cycling because, while public transport \nwas used less in many cities, the use of bicycles increased \nenormously \u2013 and the urban growth potential is very high.1 In \nany case, electric vehicles are a key disruptive force in the \nmobility market.2 \n\u2022\t\nThe number of registrations of electric and hybrid vehicles \nhas increased significantly due to increasing urbanization \nand growing demand for micromobility solutions and \nhigher legal requirements for emission reduction. \n\u2022\t\nThe European market for e-bikes and EHVs (Electric & \nHybrid Vehicles) is forecast to grow by 43\u2009% and 22\u2009% per \nyear, respectively, from 2020 until 20253. \nDue to the strategic decision to focus on fast-growing, \nsustainable end markets, such as e-mobility, hGears has turned \nout to be one of the winners of this structural change. We seize \nthe right emerging opportunities and adapt our business and \noperating models swiftly. As winners of this change, we want to \ngive back not only to our investors, but to all the people who \ncome into contact with us or are affected by our business.\nMaking the rapid growth of the mobility market sustainable to \nall stakeholders \u2013 both from a production and a distribution \nperspective \u2013 is a challenge for us. But we love challenges and \nsince hGears is known for our \u201cwe can do it\u201d attitude, we take \nresponsibility for our results. We intend to tackle all of the \ntasks this involves in the areas of governance, people and \nplanet as ambitiously as the achievement of the best product \nperformance. We walk the talk.\nAs a supplier of first-class precision gears and components for \ne-mobility applications, we see our main task in supporting the \nshift to clean mobility, and we look forward to accompanying \nour many customers on this journey. However, a \u201cgreen\u201d \nbusiness model does not automatically make a company \nsustainable. That is why, just one year after hGears\u2019 IPO, we set \nourselves the goal of producing a Non-Financial Report in \nwhich we show our stakeholders, based on a broad data basis, \nour ongoing developments towards becoming an even more \nsustainable and responsible company.\nOur journey towards sustainability has only begun, but right \nfrom the start, we want to meet the high standards of the \nWorld Economic Forum (WEF) and the Global Reporting \nInitiative (GRI), and also make our contribution to the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), wherever we can. We \nwill selectively apply the recommendations of the WEF, the \nGRI, and the SDGs as far as reasonably possible.\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has \ndefined the following material topics for hGears\u2019 industry: \nenergy management, employee health and safety, product \nlifecycle management and business ethics. Improving \nperformance in these areas has a strong positive impact on the \noverall ESG rating of the company, however, even more \nimportantly, it will contribute to the world we live in. hGears\u2019 \nsustainability strategy therefore focuses on these metrics.\nPrinciples of Governance\nEnabling Corporate Responsibility\nIn this fast-changing world, our core values remain firm.

The company is, in fact, continuing to invest \nin technologies and know-how in order to enable, on the \none hand, the evolution of the energy mix \u2013 from natural \ngas, just included in the EU legislation on taxonomy, to \nrenewables \u2013 and on the other hand in designing and \nsupplying solutions to reduce CO2 emissions in industrial \nsectors with a high carbon impact as preparation also for \nserving clients in sectors other than the energy supply \nchain.\nAt the same time, Saipem intends to contribute \u2013 right \nfrom the start \u2013 to energy decarbonisation along its \nvalue chain. In this way, the company will achieve the dual \neffect of reducing its carbon footprint and also that of its \nclients, towards whom it increasingly places itself as a \ntechnological ally on their path towards net-zero.\nThe company has adopted a two-fold strategy to \nachieve these objectives: on the one hand it proposes \nitself as a technology partner of energy companies for \ncomplex projects in order to implement them on the \npath to Net-Zero, and on the other hand as a supplier of \nmodular/scalable systems and solutions for the types of \napplications that capture CO2, recycle plastics or produce \nbiofuels that are becoming relevant for a growing number \nof industries.\nIn pursuing its objective as an enabler for the energy and \necological transition, Saipem also infuses its work with a \ncomplex of ESG factors, starting with its commitment to \nthe environment, which is also reflected in the Net-Zero \nprogramme launched by Saipem to reduce greenhouse \ngases with reference to Scope 1, 2 and 3 activities. \nEqually central to Saipem\u2019s work are health and workplace \nsafety, where protecting our workers is the primary asset, \ndefending Human Rights and business ethics, where \nattention to anti-corruption was validated in 2021 by the \nrenewal of ISO 37001:2016 certification.

Even through difficult \ntimes, it has been rewarded by consumer choices, a testament \nto its unique character and extraordinary qualities in terms of \nhealth, safety, and recyclability. Glass is an infinite resource \nwith ancient roots that is becoming increasingly popular.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Zignago Vetro Group has \nsuccessfully pursued economic and sustainable growth, despite \nthe complex general economic and geopolitical conditions. \nWe have faced soaring production factor costs, particularly \nin energy, raw materials, packaging, transportation, and other \nareas. Additionally, we witnessed a conflict erupt in the heart \nof Europe. \nHowever, this year we also left behind the pandemic and its \nrestrictions, resuming the pleasure of social relationships and \neveryday life. \nWe experienced a year of \nhard and constructive work \non the sustainability front, \none that saw us pursue our \npre-stated objectives with \nboth determination and \nperseverance, while also \nadding challenging new goals \nand important milestones to the \nmix. \nThe percentage of our production made from post-consumer \nrecycled glass (PCR) increased yet again, surpassing \nour targets and reaching 53.4%. Glass is the undisputed \nfrontrunner in terms of recyclability as it can be fully recycled \nindefinitely without compromising the quality of the resulting \ncontainer. No other material comes close to competing with \nthe intrinsic properties of glass. We have therefore set ourselves \neven more challenging recycling goals, despite the glass cutlet \ncollection and processing market being highly competitive and \nspeculative. Julia Vitrum S.p.A., our new company and the third \nGroup initiative in the glass recycling sector, has grown steadily \nand is now a point of reference in the circular economy and \nlocal reuse field in North-East Italy. \nMeanwhile, Zignago Vetro has installed a new furnace at its \nFossalta di Portogruaro facility, guaranteeing significantly \nimproved sustainability and energy efficiency. This allows the \nGroup to produce fewer emissions and make significant energy \nsavings while producing an identical product. \nThe amount of energy consumed to produce a tonne of glass \ndecreased by -2.4% compared to the previous year, and the \nGroup intends to decrease this figure by an additional -13% by \n2030. The share of electricity from renewable sources remained \nhigh at nearly 45% of the total, which is impressive considering \nthe extremely challenging energy market context. We also made \ngreat progress in terms of water consumption in 2022: further \ninvestments and increasingly prudent industrial management \nallowed us to reduce our water consumption per tonne of \nmolten glass by more than -36%, and we have confirmed some \nvery ambitious strategic targets. The energy market, specifically \nthe gas market, experienced severe tensions, threatening \nproduction disruptions due to supply interruptions. Despite these \nchallenges, Zignago Vetro responded with its characteristic \nflexibility, redirecting energy sources to guarantee operational \ncontinuity. However, the ongoing situation did hinder our target \nof reducing CO\u2082 emissions per tonne of molten glass, which \nnevertheless remains a crucial long-term goal for the Group.\nWe have undertaken several initiatives to support worthy \nenvironmental, social, and cultural causes. Some of these \ninclude contributions to reforestation initiatives, seabed clean-\nup activities, sustainable winemaking (Gambero Rosso award), \nand the provision of aid to local institutions supporting people \nand families in need, and to health care facilities. Finally, we \nsupported several cultural initiatives. The Group continued its \n\u201cZignago Vetro e l\u2019Arte\u201d project in 2022, which supports artists \nand the arts, including glass art. This involved sponsoring the \nMazzotti Gambrinus literary prize.\nWe made a", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

Toyota has \nalways demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to imagine \nand develop what is necessary to succeed in this challenge. \nAll this through its constant contribution to the realization of \na sustainable and inclusive society, thanks to innovative and \nelectrified mobility solutions and new services, to allow everyone \nto move without barriers and limitations, in total safety and \nrespect for the environment, without leaving anyone behind. \nThis commitment is embodied in the vision called \"Beyond \nZero\" according to which the goal of zero emissions is only an \nintermediate step towards a future in which moving makes the \nworld a better place. Moreover, the fundamental element of \nthe vision \"Beyond Zero\" is the use of hydrogen that embodies \nthe ambition to go \"beyond\" zero emissions, and to contribute \nnot only to the construction of a better society but to produce \nhappiness for all as well, also thanks to the better use of this \nimportant energy carrier. \nWhat we are experiencing today - in relation to the importance \nof the supply from energy sources - increasingly motivates \nLETTERS TO STAKEHOLDERS\nLETTER TO TOYOTA MOTOR \nITALIA\u2019S STAKEHOLDERS\n\n8\nthe multi-technological approach that Toyota pursues in the \nelectrification strategy, in order to offer its customers around \nthe world a wide range of solutions, with a strong focus on \ntechnologies such as battery electric and electric powered by \nhydrogen fuel cell.

When a customer needed to deliver \nCOVID-19 rapid test kits on an exceptionally tight \ntimeline, we were able to compress a 40-week job into \n14 weeks.

We met those challenges \nand kept our commitments to our \ncustomers and communities, \nthanks to the energy, imagination \nand dedication of our people.\nAcross the Company, our commitment to continually \nimproving our ESG performance and reporting is stronger \nthan ever. Over the year, we were able to build on our \nESG foundation, with our greatest focus being on the \nhealth, safety and mental wellbeing of our employees.\nEarly in the pandemic, at all of our operations, we \nhelped employees who did not need to stay on site \nmake the transition to working effectively from home. \nAt the same time, we supported site-essential \nemployees by having protocols and systems in place \nto make their\u00a0work environments as safe as possible. \nOver this time, our pandemic response was shaped by \n\u201cForward Together,\u201d our playbook for workplace \nwellbeing.

This \nstarts by attracting and retaining a talented, diverse \nand highly engaged workforce and offering a culture of \nlifelong learning and talent development, so our people, \nregardless of role, can reach their highest potential.\nAnd we are focused on strengthening our culture and \nsense of community while allowing for the flexibility \nthat is so important for supporting well-being.

The adoption of TCFD (Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures) reporting, well ahead of the regulatory \nrequirements, is a good example of that.\nThe Trustees continue to use all three building blocks of Sustainable \nInvesting, namely targeting better Environmental, Social and Governance \noutcomes for the Fund\u2019s portfolio of public and private companies. This is \nseen as key part of a robust risk management process, consistent with the \nlong-term investment horizon of the Fund. ESG now makes up a significant \npart of the Trustees\u2019 ongoing dialogue with the Fund\u2019s managers and the \nadviser as part of a fully integrated investment process. Another important \ndevelopment this year was the appointment of Sustainalytics as the Fund\u2019s \nvoting and engagement partner. This would help to materially step up our \nactivities in this area and complement the ESG integration process.  \nIt is fair to say that whilst the Trustees have achieved a lot, there is an \nhonest acknowledgement that more should and will be done. Some \nof it will be driven by better understanding and evaluation of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs involved, and that would require continuous learning \nand following (or in some cases setting) the \u201cindustry best practices\u201d. \nRegulation \u2013 both local and global \u2013 will be the other catalyst for the \nchange. The Trustees expect to be pro-active on both fronts. \nUltimately, sustainability is not just about managing risks, but also making \nprofitable investments in areas that will be part of the solution \u2013 more \nimportant than ever in the Covid-19 \u201cnew normal\u201d. The Trustees will \ncontinue to build on the strong momentum in this area, expecting to \nincrease allocation to \u201cESG tilted\u201d investments.\nI trust you find the report interesting, engaging and above \nall helpful to better understand the Trustees\u2019 approach in \nthis area.\nMaria Antoniou\nChair, TfL Pension Fund\nTfL Pension Fund\n2020 Report on Sustainable Investing\nExecutive Summary:\n\t\nIn recent years ESG investing has gained a real foothold in the investment \nindustry and in the wider society at large. Once considered niche by \nsome in the financial markets, ESG and sustainable investing is now regularly \nin the mainstream media and is expected to continue to grow rapidly over the \ncoming years.\n\t\nThis is the third year the Fund has published its Sustainable Investing \nAnnual Report and we are pleased to be able to share this now with \nyou. This Report captures the on-going efforts and evolving activities the Fund \nhas undertaken during 2019/20 as it continues along its important journey to \nintegrate ESG considerations across all of its investments. As we go to publish, \nESG issues have never been as important than they are right now, especially \nfollowing the devastating social and economic havoc wreaked by the COVID-19 \npandemic.\n\t\nAs a provider of responsible long-term capital, the Trustees strongly \nbelieve that the Fund should be an agent of positive change, \ncollaborating with like-minded investors and engaging with companies to invest \nits members\u2019 pension money sustainably and responsibly.\n\t\nThe Trustees recognise that transparency and disclosure of its ESG \nPolicy and related activities in this area is a key component of being a \nresponsible investor.\n\t\nThe Fund continues to employ the \u201cRISEN\u201d framework to reinforce its \nlong-term thinking in this area (see page 3 of this Report).\n\t\n2020 was another busy year with the Fund continuing to adapt to stay \nahead of an evolving ESG regulatory landscape. The Fund updated its \nStatement of Investment Principles (\u201cSIP\u201d) in March this year following further \nregulatory changes to the requirements for the SIP. More changes are expected \nnext year. \n\t\nIn the twelve months to 31 March 2020, carbon emissions across the \nFund\u2019s active equity and bond portfolio declined a further 3.4% and since \n2017 have fallen significantly by around 26% (see page 5 of this report).\n\t\nAcross its corporate bond portfolio, the Fund delivered a 50% reduction \nin carbon emission intensity versus the benchmark (see page 5).\n\t\n68 companies excluded across the Fund\u2019s active segregated mandates, \nbased on the criterion that the companies derived 30% or more of their \nrevenues from either thermal coal extraction or thermal coal electric generation.\n\t\nThe Fund was an early voluntary adopter of the Task Force on Climate \nRelated Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d) in its annual Report & Accounts \nfor 2020 (see", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 120.0}}}}

The challenges are complex and constantly evolving, but we remain focused \non the four pillars that shape the Mytheresa Commitment: MYPLANET, MYTALENT, \nMYPRODUCT and MYPOLICY. With each of these pillars, we\u2019ve set concrete, ambitious \nand measurable goals and we\u2019ve made meaningful strides toward our objectives:\nLIMITING OUR IMPACT ON THE PLANET\nWe made significant progress toward our goal to use only renewable electricity in our \nbusiness, reaching 92% in all operations over which we have control. This means that \nthe majority of our offices run on clean electricity. Similarly, we were able to significantly \nreduce our waste and use of single-use plastics, and we will continue to do our utmost to \nincrease the share of recycled waste. \nFOSTERING RESPONSIBLE SOURCING \nFollowing the implementation of our Animal Welfare Policy, banning exotic skins from \nSpring / Summer 2021 onwards and fur from Spring / Summer 2022 onwards, we \nare pleased that at the end of December 2022 our website was already completely \nfree of products containing exotic skins and furs, as defined in our policy. Furthermore, \nwe have now updated our policy to ban additional animal-derived materials and we \nare restricting our procurement of products containing angora and rabbit hairs. To \nfoster responsible sourcing, we have also created the Mytheresa responsible sourcing \nguidance. This document provides our brand partners with pragmatic steps that aim \nto inspire a collaborative approach to creating products using practices that are more \nrespectful of our planet, wildlife, and people - including, of course, our customers.\nFOSTERING RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION\nWe are equally pleased with our efforts to support the circular economy via our \npartnership with Bucherer. With this launch, we now offer our high-end customers in \nEurope, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom an opportunity to purchase Certified Pre-\nOwned luxury watches from brands such as Audemars Piguet or Omega. In addition, our \npartnership with the leading global platform for desirable pre-loved fashion, Vestiaire \nCollective, was rolled out to some of our US customers after the successful launch in \nEurope in June 2021. The products sold within this program for FY 23 have a total \nbuyback value of approximately \u20ac4.2 million. \nFOSTERING DIVERSITY & INCLUSION\nWe are continuously fostering diversity and equal opportunities within our company \nthrough a diverse, fair, inclusive and positive culture. Since the introduction of Diversity \n& Inclusion in our values in 2021, we implemented a mandatory training that is part of \nthe onboarding of our new team members, as well as numerous lectures and workshops. \nWe also ensure equal opportunities for all genders by a", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "recycled_waste_percent": 87.0}}}}

I encourage \nyou to read the pages ahead to learn more \nabout Trans Mountain\u2019s practices and \nthe progress we are making on our ESG \ncommitments. As a Board, we continue \nto take an active role in overseeing the \nmanagement of the company\u2019s ESG  \nrisks and opportunities.\nIn August 2022, the Board appointed Dawn Farrell to \nthe position of President and Chief Executive Officer \nand member of the Board of Directors. We were \nconfident that her broad-based knowledge, experience, \nand her background with governments and Indigenous \ncommunities would be a tremendous asset to \nTrans\u00a0Mountain as it completed the Expansion Project \nand navigated the next stages of the company\u2019s future. \nThis has proven to be true.\nEach day, we are closer to completion of our  \nExpansion Project and to realizing the benefits that  \nthe expanded pipeline and marine terminal will bring \nto the Canadian economy. After construction is \ncompleted, we expect approximately 700 new jobs \nwill be created to support continuing operations, \nrepresenting an increase of ~75\u00a0per cent of our \nworkforce. More importantly, unlocking access to \nglobal markets will enable Canadian energy producers \nto achieve world prices for oil exported to the \nUnited\u00a0States and Asia, forecasted to remain robust \nfor decades to come. This will ultimately mean greater \nprosperity for all Canadians with higher tax revenues \nhelping to fund essential programs and services.\nTrans Mountain continues to steward best practices \nwith respect to ESG issues. When it comes to building \nmajor infrastructure projects, Canada has among \nthe world\u2019s highest standards for the protection of \npeople, preservation of the environment, as well \nas consultation and engagement with Indigenous \ncommunities. These standards have been embedded \ninto the Expansion Project design and construction \nmethodologies and will continue to guide how the \ncompany operates when the expansion is complete.\nThe Trans Mountain Expansion Project has an \nimportant role to play in economic reconciliation \nwith Indigenous communities. Trans Mountain\u2019s \nrelationships with Indigenous communities are \nbased on trust and respect. We continue to identify \nopportunities to create significant economic and \nemployment opportunities for Indigenous, local,  \nand regional workers across the pipeline corridor, \nduring the expansion phase and into the future.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to \noffer my thanks to all Trans Mountain employees and \ncontractors for their hard work and commitment.  \nYour contributions are making it possible to continue to \ntransport oil safely and responsibly to the West\u00a0Coast, \nand your efforts have been essential to reaching \nimportant Expansion Project milestones. We have \nconfidence that together we will continue to meet  \nthe ambitious objectives we set togeth", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

The unfolding war in Europe, \nthe cost-of living crisis, the after-effects of the pandemic and the continuing climate emergency \nare impacting individuals across the world and will continue to do so. \nEurope's efforts to work toward a more sustainable future has become an even greater task since \nthe outbreak of Ukraine war. Energy supply has been squeezed, global commodities as well as food \nprices have increased, and green plans have been derailed. \nBut in challenge there is possibility. The war has shown us the urgency of resolving the question of \nenergy security. It should give us greater motivation and focus in our work towards a greener future. \nUniCredit has always been committed to a fair and just energy transition. We recognise that the \nlonger-term global threat of climate change remains unchanged and ever more pressing.

We are faced with a strained global economy already suffering from the \neffects of the pandemic as well as supply chains under significant stress, all compounded by ever \nconstricted energy markets and escalating global commodity prices. The war in Ukraine has only \nexacerbated these adverse trends and the economic and humanitarian repercussions of rising \ncosts of energy and food are intensifying. \nThese disruptions occur in the broader and ongoing context of an ever-present climate crisis, \nwhose effective mitigation will require a global transition to a low-carbon economy. If we are to \nlimit global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius and stay on track to meet the ambitious goals set \nout in the Paris Agreement, we need to make a collective effort to accelerate the transition of the \nglobal economy.\nHowever, in amongst the adversity we can find opportunity, and it is more important than ever \nthat we see the possibilities in this transition; the required economic transformation will not only \ncreate immediate commercial opportunities but also open up the prospect of a fundamentally \ntransformed global economy with lower energy costs being one of numerous benefits, including \nimproved health outcomes and enhanced conservation of natural capital. The transition will also \nbring new growth opportunities, as decarbonization creates efficiencies and opens markets for \nlow-emissions products and services.\nEffective actions to accelerate decarbonization include shifting the energy mix away from fossil \nfuels, increasing energy efficiency and managing demand for energy.

The striking images of \nthe devastation that the event caused in Germany and \nBelgium made it abundantly clear that climate change is no \nlonger just an abstract scientific problem. The impact of \nclimate change is only going to become more significant, \nand we are not going to be immune to its effects in this part \nof the world.\nThe events in the summer of 2021 provided yet more evi-\ndence that limiting global warming and protecting the \nnatural resources required for life on earth are one of the \nmost important challenges facing us as a society. That is \nwhy environmental and climate protection have such an \nimportant role to play in our sustainability strategy. We \nsupport targets set at an international level, such as the \n1.5\u00b0C target set out in the Paris Agreement and the European \nUnion Green Deal, as well as the goal set by the German \nFederal Government in 2021 to achieve climate neutrality by \n2045. The Austrian government is going even further, and \nwants to be climate neutral by 2040. The world of business \nhas an active role to play in achieving this target. It can also \ndrive the research and development that will be needed in \norder to reach global climate targets. The real estate sector \nhas an important part to play in this because the construc-\ntion and operation of buildings emit a significant amount of \nthe greenhouse gases that cause climate change. As the \nhousing industry market leader in Europe, we aim to be a \ncentral driving force behind climate protection. With a \nportfolio of 413,967 residential units (excl. Deutsche \nWohnen) in Germany, Austria and Sweden and its involve-\nment in a number of wide-ranging development activities, \n\u00adVonovia has a significant role to play in protecting our \nenvironment and mitigating climate change. \n > Climate path for the existing German portfolio \nupdated: virtually climate-neutral building \nportfolio by 2045 set as target (<25 kg CO\u2082e/m\u00b2 \nby 2030)\n > Carbon intensity in Germany improved by 2.8% \nto 38.4 kg CO2e/m\u00b2\n > 2.3% refurbishment rate achieved in Germany\n > Decarbonization tool for implementing environ-\nmental targets on regional and neighborhood \nlevels.

This is a very good situation, but one \nthat entails great responsibility, too. We are able to help ensure that people in cities have homes worth living in. \n\u00adHow\u00adever, it is also a challenging position. It puts our company under the microscope for a number of stakeholder \ngroups, who all have very different expectations from us. \nWe investigate these expectations immediately because we want to fulfil them, as far as they fall under our responsibili-\nties, to the fullest extent possible. This isn\u2019t always an easy task. Finding solutions to varying demands often involves \ncompromise. But by maintaining dialogue we are always able to bring different points of view together. \nOur business approach is also helpful in this regard. As a service provider and the provider of homes for around one \nmillion people, our focus is on our customers and their needs. With this in mind, we preserve our buildings and actively \nshape the residential environment. This is also why we are committed to offering contemporary, senior-friendly apart-\nments and developing services that offer better quality of living. Our focus on customers is also the reason why we are \naddressing a social issue that is particularly important at the moment: the construction of new apartments. \nLast year we began construction work on more than 1,000 apartments; in the coming years it will be significantly more. \nThe new apartments will not be constructed just anywhere, but where they are needed: in conurbations. The average \nrent for the apartments in our portfolio is around \u20ac6.50 per m2. This is affordable for the large majority of people. \nTo some extent, we also consider it our responsibility to ensure that people can live together in their neighborhoods \nharmoniously. That is why we are implementing comprehensive neighborhood projects throughout Germany, cooperat-\ning with charities, promoting cultural and neighborhood projects and working closely with the local communities. In the \npast year alone, we invested \u20ac50 million in neighborhood projects like this. We also donate money through our founda-\ntions. It is also our aim to understand interaction in our neighborhoods better and are therefore actively investing in \nresearch in this area. We are financing an endowed professorship in Bochum for research into neighborhood develop-\nment.\nWe support the German government\u2019s ambitious target of achieving an almost climate-neutral building stock by 2050 \nthrough a number of measures to reduce energy consumption and the release of CO2e emissions. Implementing energy-\u00ad\nefficiency modernizations and maintaining buildings are important measures in this regard. We were able to achieve a \nrefurbishment rate of 5% once more in 2018 and thereby significantly improve the energy intensity of many buildings. \nThis shows that we are on the right track. \n\u2002102-14\n\n Vonovia SE Sustainability Report 2018\nEDITORIAL\n4\nI\u2019m pleased that we are also very popular as an employer now, too. Almost 10,000 people work for us \nnow \u2013 around 1,000 of those are located in Austria and Sweden. The majority of our employees is in  \ndirect contact with our customers, which also makes their work very valuable in a social sense.

Un \nnemico invisibile ha stravolto le nostre vite e ci ha \nimposto la distanza sociale come meccanismo di \ndifesa. La pandemia ha fatto emergere gli squilibri e le \ndisuguaglianze che minacciano la coesione sociale e le \ndifficolt\u00e0 nella costruzione di pratiche che garantiscano \nun futuro sostenibile, responsabile e inclusivo per tutti.\nAllo stesso tempo, il 2020 ha incubato il cambiamento \npi\u00f9 concentrato che abbiamo mai conosciuto: a causa \ndell\u2019emergenza sanitaria da Covid-19, in pochi mesi ci \nsiamo abituati a lavorare senza incontrarci, a imparare \na distanza, a celebrare insieme ma separati, grazie a \npiattaforme digitali. Ci siamo chiesti in passato quale \nsarebbe stato il principale motore della trasformazione \ndigitale delle aziende e delle societ\u00e0, se questo ruolo \nsarebbe stato assunto dagli Azionisti, dai manager o \ndalle istituzioni. Ebbene, la risposta che diamo oggi \u00e8 \nche quel motore \u00e8 stata la pandemia, che ci ha spinto \nad abbracciare la trasformazione digitale con una \nforza e una velocit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 grandi di quanto avremmo mai \nimmaginato. \nLa nostra nuova rete mobile, certificata Top Quality, ci \nha permesso di garantire la continuit\u00e0 del servizio con \nuna qualit\u00e0 molto alta, nonostante l\u2019aumento drastico \ndi traffico voce e dati. Le nostre iniziative rivolte ai \npi\u00f9 giovani hanno contribuito a garantire accesso \nall\u2019istruzione e a educare alla digitalizzazione durante \nl\u2019obbligo della Didattica a Distanza. Ci siamo confermati \nTop Employer, proteggendo efficacemente le nostre \npersone e adattandoci rapidamente all\u2019emergenza. \nE la nostra assistenza clienti, riprogrammata per \nlo svolgimento in smart working, ha continuato a \nraggiungere i milioni di clienti WINDTRE con soluzioni \nda remoto che, in tutta sicurezza, hanno garantito loro la \nnostra vicinanza. \nL\u2019emergenza e l\u2019adattamento che ne \u00e8 conseguito non \nci ha distratto dal nostro impegno ambientale: nel 2020 \nWINDTRE ha conseguito gli obiettivi di riduzione \ndelle emissioni di CO2 definiti insieme al WWF nel \n2017, con un abbattimento di oltre il 70% delle emissioni \nper unit\u00e0 di traffico e di pi\u00f9 del 18% delle emissioni \nassolute.\nSono quindi pi\u00f9 che mai fiero di tutta la squadra \nWINDTRE e dell\u2019impegno dimostrato in un anno davvero \neccezionale. E lo sono anche perch\u00e9 quest\u2019anno siamo \nstati capaci di guardare ancora pi\u00f9 avanti. Perch\u00e9 se \nvogliamo determinare un cambiamento, dobbiamo fare \nin modo che avvenga. \nNoi lo abbiamo fatto costruendo insieme ai nostri \nmanager, ai nostri giovani e ai nostri principali \nstakeholder un ambizioso piano di sostenibilit\u00e0 che \nha il suo orizzonte nel 2030, che include obiettivi \nmisurabili, concreti e totalmente integrati nel nostro \nbusiness, e che ci guider\u00e0 nei prossimi anni lungo un \npercorso di implementazione progressivo e trasparente. \nCi impegneremo infatti per continuare a rendere \nconsapevoli e sicure le famiglie, i giovani e le imprese \nsul web, per garantire l\u2019inclusione digitale dei senior e \ndelle persone con disabilit\u00e0, per superare il digital divide \ngeografico e di servizi, per migliorare la parit\u00e0 di genere \ne la preparazione al futuro delle nostre persone, e per \nsalvaguardare l\u2019ambiente in cui viviamo con impegni \nchiari e sfidanti. \nIn questo documento potete quindi leggere chi siamo, \nscoprire i risultati che abbiamo gi\u00e0 raggiunto e gli \nimpegni che abbiamo assunto per costruire un futuro \nmigliore.

We also aim to reach 100% sustainable \ncustomer-facing packaging by 2026, and we are already more than \nhalfway to meeting that goal. We continue to push the boundaries \nof waste diversion in our restaurants, most notably through the \nrollout of new, clear drink cups that more customers can recycle.\nAt the beginning of 2022, we announced that we would be tying \nexecutive compensation to Good Done Right performance with \na portion of executives\u2019 2022 incentive compensation linked to \nthe Company\u2019s achievements in our Food, People and Footprint \nfocus areas.

Penegor, President and CEO\nThis progress would not be possible without the partnership of \nour franchisees, suppliers, employees and restaurant teams, \nand the support of our Board of Directors and stockholders. \nThe collaboration among these groups is what makes the \nWendy\u2019s family truly special. \nMarkers of progress \nIn Food, we made considerable headway toward our goal of \nresponsibly sourcing our top 10 priority food categories by \n2030. Of note, we identified approximately 140 suppliers in \nscope for our responsible sourcing program, established \ncriteria for measuring progress and enlisted a technology \npartner to assess supplier performance.\u202fWe also achieved \nthe 10-year goal we set in 2012 to transition our pork \nsupply chain in the U.S. and Canada away from sow \ngestation stalls in favor of open pen or group housing for \nconfirmed pregnant sows. \nFrom our executive leaders to the crew in each restaurant, we \nhave set high goals for our People, who continue to rise to the \noccasion. We are building more pathways aimed at increasing \nthe diversity of representation across our restaurant support \nstaff, Company restaurant teams and franchise community.

Stating this commitment is admirable, but \nputting those words into action is what\u2019s important if \nwe wish to enact real change.\nIn fiscal year 2022, Adient did just that, undertaking \nmany initiatives that continued to further our ESG \njourney. This included the publication of three important \ndocuments: Adient\u2019s Deforestation Policy, Human Rights \nPolicy Statement and DE&I Commitment Statement. \nThe Deforestation Policy reiterates our commitment to \nprocuring forest commodities from more sustainable \nsources to reduce our potential impact on deforestation \nand climate change. Our Human Rights Policy provides \nan overview of our priorities and commitments in the \narea of human rights, and our DE&I Commitment \nStatement recognizes the importance of diversity in \nenhancing our culture and business performance.\nIn addition, we have taken concrete steps to enact \nchange though alliances such as our agreement with H2 \nGreen Steel to supply fossil-free steel with a low carbon \nfootprint from 2026 on for use in Adient\u2019s world-class \nmetals products.\nOn the product front, our engineers and designers \ncontinue to focus on developing more sustainable \nproducts, such as Adient\u2019s UltraThin\u2122 seat, recently \nrecognized with a Future of Lightweighting award at \nthe 2022 Altair Enlighten Awards. This sustainable \nseat technology does not exist anywhere else in the \nautomotive industry. \nWe have established three regional DE&I Councils as \nwell as nearly two dozen employee-run business resource \ngroups (BRGs) globally that further our grassroots efforts \nin diversity, equity and inclusion. These BRGs focus on \nprofessional development, community outreach and \neducation to create an inclusive culture. In addition, \nwe leverage our high-potential employee development \nprogram, Adient Accelerate, to tackle key business \nchallenges through action-learning projects. In fiscal \nyear 2022, three of these projects were aligned to ESG \ntopics \u2014 Renewable Energy, New Start Electrical Vehicle \nBusiness Strategy and Employee Development (Social \nSustainability).\nAll these efforts are significant steps in our continuing \nESG journey. They demonstrate that Adient has firmly \nintegrated sustainability into the core of our business to \nbecome the foremost sustainable automotive seating \nsupplier. We have dedicated talent, technology and \nsustainable processes globally to enrich our sustainability \nprogram. We have implemented robust policies and \nprocedures to enhance our ESG governance structure \nand responsibilities. Additionally, we have improved our \nability to gather quality data to track our progress in a \nsystematic and reliable manner. \nAdient continues to receive support from our Board of \nDirectors, leadership team and managers to drive our \nsuccess at all levels of the organization and within our \nsupply base. \nI join the entire global Adient team in sharing this year\u2019s \naccomplishments and goals in our 2022 Sustainability \nReport as we continue to do our part to lessen our \nenvironmental impact on the world and create a more \nsustainable future.\nDoug Del Grosso\nAdient President and CEO \nESG at Adient\nAppendix\nProtecting\nthe Environment\nPeople and\nCommunities\nGovernance and\nCompliance\nTable of Contents\n2022 Sustainability Report  |  4\n\nCompany Overview\nAt Adient, we are always innovating and continually improvi", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

With these as its base, Alfa Laval aims to help \nenhance the productivity and competitiveness of its \ncustomers in various industries throughout the world. \nWe de\ufb01ne their challenges and deliver sustainable products \nand solutions that meet their requirements \u2013 mainly in \nenergy, the environment, food and the marine industry.\nAlfa Laval\n\nAlfa Laval is helping to achieve 15 of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development \nGoals through products and solutions that improve energy efficiency, \nreduce emissions, purify water, minimize waste and lead to the efficient \nuse of raw materials.\nOperations handles production-related procurement, distribution and logistics on \na global basis and ensures that anything sold by the three divisions is produced \nand delivered in line with the promise made to the customer.\nThe need to heat, cool, transport and separate arises in many industries: \nfood, energy, pharmaceuticals, refineries or petrochemicals \u2013 Alfa Laval can \nhelp in the majority of them. End customers are reached through the Energy, \nFood & Water and Marine divisions.\nFor whom?\nWhere?\nSustainability?\nHow?\nAlfa Laval\u2019s products, systems and services are sold in more than 100 countries. \nMore than 110 service centers deliver services in over 160 countries This means \nthat Alfa Laval is close to its customers, ready to help at a moment\u2019s notice\nwhen the need arises.\nHeat transfer\nCompact heat exchangers that recycle heat, optimize customers\u2019 energy \nconsumption, cut costs and reduce negative environmental impact.\nSeparation\nSeparators, decanter centrifuges, filters, strainers and membranes that separate \nliquids from other liquids and solid particles from liquids or gases.\nFluid handling\nPumps, valves, tank cleaning equipment and installation material for industries \nwith stringent hygiene requirements as well as pumping systems specifically \nfor the marine industry and the offshore market.\nWhat?\n\n5\nTwo renewable sources of energy that bring hope of a brighter future. They reduce the carbon \nfootprint dramatically and are expected to account for half the world\u2019s electricity generation in \nten years\u2019 time. There is only one big problem: when the sun is not shining and the wind does \nnot blow, no power is generated. Unless the energy can be stored effectively on a large scale. \nAs part-owner of a new company, Alfa Laval\u2019s knowledge and expertise is playing an important\nrole in turning this challenge into reality.\nOur unique and specially designed heat exchangers convert electrical energy from solar and wind \nplants into thermal energy. The heat is then stored and preserved in gigantic bays of molten salt \n\u2013 like a natural battery \u2013 waiting to be awakened and transformed back into electricity when \nneeded in the grid. So, even on grey days, the forecast looks bright.\nSolar and wind\n\n6\nAlfa Laval performed well in 2020 and we remain fully committed \nto our long-term strategy while leveraging the changing market \nconditions. Increased investments in our technology leadership, \na stronger focus on expanding the service offering, and the \ndevelopment of a more customer-oriented culture with faster \ndecision making continue to be our key strategic ambitions.

Thanks to the tremendous effort \nand commitment of our employees, working together as one Alpha Trains team, we \nhave achieved great results.\nWe have every reason to be proud and I would like to thank everyone for their contri-\nbution, commitment and courage in this challenging year.\nWe have assessed the challenges described above as having little impact on our \nbusiness, and in some areas even a positive impact.\nFor example, vehicle utilisation is a key measure of our financial performance, and \nthis year we achieved record levels in our locomotive division, complemented by \n100% utilisation in our passenger division. In fact, for seven months in 2022 we \nachieved 100% utilisation across the Group (locomotives and passenger trains). \nThese are remarkable milestones and a testament to our people who ensure that \nwe deliver the right vehicles, at the right time, under the right conditions, to our \ngrowing customer base.\n2022 \u2013 OUR JOURNEY TO GREATER SUSTAINABILITY\nDespite the challenges of 2022, we have maintained our focus on sustainability.\nHere are just some of our achievements:\nNew LEED-certified office in Cologne\nIn February, Alpha Trains moved into its new sustainable office in Cologne. Built to \nthe latest energy and environmental design guidelines and awarded a LEED (Leader-\nship in Energy and Environmental Design) certificate, the office meets the company\u2019s \nhigh standards for sustainability.\nUN Global Signatory and our commitment to the SDGs\nAlpha Trains has been a signatory of the UN Global Compact for two years and is \ncommitted to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nSuccessful ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 recertification\nIn October 2022, Alpha Trains successfully passed the annual external audit for ISO \n14001 and ISO 45001. The auditors from T\u00dcV Rheinland Group commented very po-\nsitively on our sustainability strategy and the maturity of our sustainability system.\nGRESB Assessment 2022\nIn October 2022, Alpha Trains demonstrated sustainable leadership at its best and \nachieved a world-class result for Alpha Trains in the GRESB benchmark\n  \u00071st place overall in the GRESB assessment (out of 649 participants worldwide)\n  \u0007Sector Leader in Transport and Sector Leader in Transport/Rail Companies\n  \u0007GRESB 5-star rating for the sixth consecutive year\n  \u0007\u00adMaximum possible score of 100 out of 100\nA result we are very proud of.\n\nNew Green Finance Framework\nIn December 2022, Alpha Trains refinances existing debt and secures growth finan-\ncing, adding a total of \u20ac548 million to its green loan base. The new Green Finance \nFramework is aligned with the latest Green Bond & Green Loan Principles and the EU \ntaxonomy.\nContinued carbon neutrality\nIn December 2022, Alpha Trains continued its journey as a sustainable locomotive \nand train rental company in continental Europe to become carbon neutral, underli-\nning the rental company\u2019s strong commitment to sustainability.\nSocial initiatives\nAlso in December 2022, Alpha Trains continued to support local charity initiatives. \nInstead of Christmas gifts for customers, we have decided to donate the money to \nthree local charity projects.\nAlpha Trains receives EcoVadis Gold Medal\nWe are delighted to announce that we have been awarded the \u201cEcoVadis Gold\u201d \naward, placing us in the top 5% of sustainable companies assessed by EcoVadis \nworldwide.\nAnd a few more achievements in key words\n  Flexible work from home policy\n  Free public transport passes for our Cologne employees\n  Our e-bike leasing scheme for all employees\n  Improved car policy to promote electric and hybrid company cars\n  \u0007Ongoing HSE awareness, regular training and consistent tracking of regular \ninspections.\n2023 \u2013 OUR NEXT STEPS\nWe are convinced and excited by the incredible potential of \nmodal shift to rail as a lever to reduce the overall environmen-\ntal impact of transport. We will therefore continue to seize the \nopportunities it offers to improve the sustainability of a modern \nsociety.\nAs a company, we aim to maintain and expand our \nrole as a ", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Throughout the year, we \nfocused on strengthening the \nfoundation of our ESG program in \nprivate equity, driving significant \nprogress toward achieving goals \nand effectuating positive change. \nI am proud of what we have built and, \nmore importantly, of the progress we \nhave made.

Introduction \nMessage from Chairman of the Executive Committee \nIt is my pleasure to present to you this ESG report, which outlines our company's \ncommitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Here at ARICOMA, \nwe believe that conducting business in a responsible and sustainable manner is not only \nthe right thing to do but is also essential for long-term success. \nIn this report, we highlight our efforts to minimise our impact on the environment, \npromote social well-being, and uphold high standards of corporate governance. We \nrecognise that our actions as a company can have a significant impact on the world \naround us, and we take our responsibilities seriously. \nOur company is pursuing the target of reducing emissions per employee by 20% over the \nnext 5 years. As a result, we are also going to significantly decrease our energy \nconsumption, which will have a positive impact not only on our cost base, but also on the \nenvironment. \nIn general, our ESG initiatives include reducing our carbon footprint, informal support of \ndiversity and inclusion, promoting employee health and safety, and ensuring transparent \nand ethical business practices. We strive to engage with our stakeholders and listen to \ntheir concerns, so that we can continue to improve and make a positive impact in the \ncommunities where we operate. \nWe also consider it a particularly important part of our ESG initiative to support various \nnon-profit organisations or culture as such, being a proud partner National Theatre, \nMemory of Nations organisation, etc. \nWe understand that ESG factors are increasingly important to investors, customers, \nemployees, and other stakeholders, and we are committed to integrating these \nconsiderations into our decision-making processes. By doing so, we aim to create value \nfor all our stakeholders and contribute to a more sustainable future. \nThank you for taking the time to read this report, and we welcome your feedback and \nsuggestions as we continue to pursue our ESG goals. \nIf \nyou \nwish \nto \nshare \nyour \nfeedback \nwith \nus, \nplease \ncontact \nus \nat \nsustainability@aricoma.com. \nMilan Same\u0161 \nChairman of the Executive Committee \nARICOMA Group \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \nCompany profile \nARICOMA Group is a European information technology company that combines the \ncapabilities of its individual group companies to provide customers with high-quality \nindividualised and complex solutions that help them to achieve their goals.  \nFounded in 2017 with a vision of becoming a major European IT services player, ARICOMA \nGroup offers IT services, via its member companies, to corporate and government clients, \nincluding application and software development, integration and implementation of IT \nsystems, managed services, data centres, hardware sale, cyber security services and \ncloud services. \nWith its headquarters i", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 1.0}}}}

This created a highly \ninflationary and volatile environment for \nboth company and farmers. \nThanks to strong execution by employ-\nees and management, Arla once again \nproved agile in navigating these difficult \nconditions. Coupled with a decline in \nglobal milk production which drove \ncommodity prices upwards, this enabled \na higher return to our farmer owners.  \nThe average prepaid milk price in 2022 \nwas 52.0 EUR-cent/kg, 40.5 per cent \nhigher than the previous year. The finan-\ncial performance allowed for supple-\nmentary payment of EUR 269 million, \ncorresponding to 2.2 EUR-cent per kg \nowner milk, above the level set in Arla\u2019s \nretainment policy.

In August 2022, \nwe delivered on that commitment in a new way by organizing \nan unprecedented event in our company\u2019s history. \u201cONE Atea\u201d \nbrought together all our employees at a special event here in \nOslo, with our sustainability plans high on the agenda. In doing \nso, we made a compelling case that Atea is truly The Place \nto Be!\nThat spirit of unity helped guide us throughout 2022, as we \ncontinued to develop our programs in sustainability-infused \ncorporate performance. \nFor instance, Atea once again earned a top ranking by \nCorporate Knights\u201449th place globally\u2014as well as a top \n1% ranking by EcoVadis. We also earned a Leadership \nBand placement among global companies analyzed by the \nCDP, a non-profit organization that runs the world\u2019s leading \nenvironmental disclosure platform. This marks a new personal \nbest for our company since first reporting to CDP over ten \nyears ago. And we achieved a new record with our Goitloop \nconcept. Today, it\u2019s one of the largest reuse-and-recycle \nprograms in Northern Europe. You can read more details about \neach of these achievements (among others) in this report. \nWe remain united in the face of events here in Europe, \nproviding humanitarian support and relief to Ukraine and its \ncitizens, standing shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors \nagainst unlawful aggression.\nIn times of uncertainty\u2014colored by inflation, pandemic \nrecovery and other challenging events\u2014united is how we \npersevere.

While there is still much work to do, and certain prevention protocols \nwill remain for some time, our organization has been reflecting on the last 18 months.\nWe do so with a sense of pride for how we prioritized the health and safety of our associates, and for our \ncontributions as an essential supplier to many of the world\u2019s crucial products and services. We also find value in the \nmany learnings and opportunities that have surfaced, as the experience of the pandemic has shaped behaviors, \npriorities and lifestyles for generations to come.\nAmong them is that the response and recovery effort confirmed something we at Avient have always known\u2014that the \nrole our material science plays in sustainability for the world is more important than ever. Avient answered the call to \ndeliver much needed healthcare supplies, including facemasks, ventilators, test kits, and other PPE. We were there for \nthe food and consumer product supply chain, allowing for long shelf life of perishable goods and for safe handling of \ncleaning and sanitization supplies. For IT infrastructure that enabled the shift to remote work and for high performance \napplications as people of the world adapted lifestyles to more outdoor activities\u2026we were there.\n \nAs the world now seeks the next generation of sustainable solutions\u2026we are also there. From increasing post \nconsumer recycled (PCR) and bio-polymer content, to improving the overall recyclability of plastics, our technology \nteams are proudly collaborating with customers to bring new innovations to market.\nAt the same time, we have continued to invest in the environmental, social and governance priorities that are \nincumbent upon companies today, including actions that address climate change. We have updated performance \nprogress toward our 2030 Sustainability Goals as well as expanded commitments, such as utilizing 100% renewable \nenergy and becoming operationally carbon neutral by 2050. Herein you\u2019ll also find increased reporting and \ntransparency in each of four sustainability cornerstones: People, Products, Planet and Performance.\nThe purpose of our Sustainability Report is not solely ESG compliance and reporting.

Confronted with supply \nchain disruption, and concerned with the \nwellbeing of our global community, we forged \nahead with renewed ambition to do better; \nworking out ways to make our product more \nefficiently, minimising our environmental \nimpact, and taking care of our people at every \nstep of the way. \nMany of the changes we implemented as a \nresult of the pandemic continued to be of \nvalue in 2021. We held on to new traditions of \ndigitally connecting our worldwide workforce. \nOur virtual showroom, originally developed \namid widespread travel restrictions, continued \nto evolve, providing us with an innovative way \nto showcase our designs without the air miles. \nDuring a second year of Covid restrictions, \nwe truly appreciated our collective need \nto make time for creativity and inspiration. \nThis led us to introduce Bally Smart Talks, in \nwhich philosophers, artists, innovators and \nacademics shared their personal experiences \nand thought-provoking ideas with our Bally \nCommunity. \nThe pandemic impacted every area of our \nbusiness, but it hasn\u2019t stopped us from \nmaking sustainability a priority. The climate \ncrisis represents the biggest threat to \nhumanity, and we will never lose sight of this \nhumbling fact. Together with our industry, \nwe are responsible for shaping the future \nof fashion and redefining its purpose. It\u2019s \nencouraging to see our recent 77% score leap \nin the Fashion Transparency Index, published \nby the global movement Fashion Revolution. \nNot only has our commitment to sustainability \nevolved, but our ability to measure and \ndemonstrate our progress has too, with the \ndetail provided in this report growing more \nsophisticated and more meaningful each year. \nSince we drew up our Sustainability Roadmap \nin 2019, we have been committed to providing \nevidence of our actions. In 2021, we mapped \nand published a list of the main Tier 1 and \nTier 2 suppliers active in our supply chain in \n2020. Not only does this improve our level of \ntransparency, it helps us to uncover and plan \nmore sustainable ways of bringing our pieces \nto life in future. \nFor 170 years, we\u2019ve been making products \nthat stand the test of the time, but that\u2019s only \npart of the story today. We\u2019re now re-imagining \nmore responsible ways to bring our designs \ninto being. The 2021 Bally Wilson Echo, a \nsneaker made entirely from materials on our \nrecyclable and sustainable list, is an example \nof such innovation. Building on the success \nCEO Message\n3\nCEO MESSAGE\n\n4\nof our B-Echo collection, we have continued \nto expand our use of regenerated leather, \nrepurposed PET mesh and recycled nylon \nacross the rest of our designs, with Mythos, \nCrew and Explore product lines all made using \nthese more sustainable materials. Meanwhile, \ninitiatives such as our Scribe Renewal \nProgram see iconic Bally designs being \nkept in circulation for longer, upholding our \ntradition of creating longstanding wardrobe \nstaples \u2013 a much-needed antidote to a world \ndominated by disposable fashion. \n \nIn 2021, we also calculated our footprint in \ncompliance with the leading Greenhouse \nGas Protocol Corporate Standard, a complex \nprocess that ultimately classifies our \nemissions into three scopes. This data sets \nthe foundation for science-based target \nsetting in 2023 and will inform our plan for \nthe reduction of CO2 emissions.

{"task": "Quantitative ESG data extraction", "input": "Packaging categories\n\u2022\t Packaging refers to packaging and other products within the foodservice, grocery and retail sectors which are facing legislation or \nconsumer pressure.\n\u2022\t Packaging sales only includes those sales of products that will be ultimately bought or used by consumers. Sales of packaging \nrelated products bought by business customers for non retail purposes are captured as non packaging revenue.\n\u2022\t In future years packaging and products may move between categories and/or may be added or removed (for example, as \nlegislation changes, recyclability improves or if a new line of products is launched).\n\u2022\t We have exercised our judgement to allocate sales to the packaging and non-packaging categories as explained below. There are \ncertain limitations with respect to the accuracy and completeness of the packaging categories as it is not always possible to \nevidence the exact composition of our products across the vast range that we sell. Judgements with respect to allocating \nproducts to categories are taken at a point in time, and both evolving legislation and changes in product composition mean that it \nis likely we will recognise adjustments, both current and retrospective, akin to those we have disclosed below this year as we \ncontinue to enhance the quality of our data. We will continue to disclose such adjustments where they are of significance to year \non year trends in our packaging-related data.\nWe review the categorisation of our products and packaging on a quarterly basis as part of our internal controls process and have \nmade two changes this year.\n\u2022\t Food containers made from Expanded Polystyrene \u2018EPS\u2019 have been moved from category 3 to category 2. Several of the countries \nwhere we operate have announced legislation restricting the use of this material in the takeaway foodservice sector and we are \nactively transitioning customers to alternative materials with no reductions in volume. As these restrictions have not been \napplied consistently across our Group (for example, c.94% of our sales in this product category are in United States of America \nwhere EPS is not widely restricted) and they do not impact the fresh produce sector in some of our markets, we have positioned \nthese sales in \u2018Consumable plastics likely to transition\u2019. \n\u2022\t Baking paper and parchment products have moved from category 4 to category 3. Despite c.99% of the material in the product \nbeing renewable and recyclable, the presence of a silicone coating means these products cannot be widely recycled.

They also provide standardised and sanitised \nESG information that can easily integrate into analysis and risk management processes. \nWe have used our proprietary ESG methodology of assessing 600+ KPIs to score 1,000 companies across ~65 \nsectors. This evaluation is based on publicly available information released by the companies through their \nwebsites, exchange filings, annual reports, investor presentations, sustainability reports, etc. It also factors in other \nmaterial ESG information available in the public domain through reliable sources, such as data reported by industry \nassociations, regulators and various government agencies. The assessment is based on quantitative as well as \nqualitative disclosures.  \nSince this is an objective evaluation based on publicly available information, the quality of disclosures provided in \nthe public domain is an important determinant of the ESG score, hence CRISIL also provides a Disclosure score \ncategory across companies we score. This becomes imperative for financial institutions and corporates to \nunderstand the level of transparency in terms of reporting non-financial disclosures. \nWe strongly recommend and encourage all companies under our coverage to report maximum possible ESG-\nrelated information in the public domain. This is in sync with good governance principles and best practices around \ntransparency \u2013 an important pillar of our ESG assessments.  \nEach company under our coverage is monitored on a continuous surveillance basis for ESG material events that \ncould potentially lead to a change in scores. \nScoring framework   \nTo arrive at the overall company ESG score, relevant weights are assigned to E (35%), S (25%) and G (40%) \nattributes, to reflect the relative importance of factors. Governance has been assigned the highest weightage as we \nbelieve that good governance practices are the bed rock to drive environment and social agenda of any company. \nCompanies are scored on a scale of 0-100, where 100 is the highest.  \nIn case of Environment and Social assessments, the final score is a combination of the company and the sector \nscores, where sector scores have a 40% weight in the company\u2019s E score and 25% in its S score. The company E \nscore assesses its material environment parameters in relation to its peers within the sector. The sector E score is \nan indicator of how the sector fares relative to other sectors on various environment issues. This approach allows \nus the flexibility to bring nuanced sector-specific parameters into our assessment, while at the same time retaining \nthe cross-sector comparability of the final scores. \nGiven India\u2019s Net Zero target of 2070, many Indian companies have aligned their sustainability strategies to help \nachieve this target. Transition or Parivartan parameters especially such as climate change policy, net zero targets, \ntrend in emission intensity, use of green/alternate raw materials, green product offerings, investments etc. are \nembedded within CRISIL\u2019s evaluation framework to assess the change in quantitative and qualitative metrics \ntoward achieving these sustainability goals. Hence, CRISIL has not provided a separate transition score for fiscal \n2022 evaluations.  \nEnhancing the ESG evaluation framework \nIn the assessment of companies for the fiscal year ending 2022, CRISIL has enhanced ESG assessment \nframework- The parameters assessed for fiscal year ended 2022 on environment category increased from 35 to 65 \nwhich includes sector specific parameters that are material to the industry, that for social category increased from \n40 to 100 including the BRSR linked parameters such as worker related parameters, complaints from various \nstakeholders, data security related issues, etc., and from 60 to 100 for corporate governance category, compared to \nfiscal year ended 2021. This includes using more digitized approach of scoring, the incorporation of sector-specific \n\n \n \nResearch \n3 \ndata points for more comprehensive evaluation, & integration of BRSR parameters to refine scoring, and the \ndevelopment of a digitized controversy framework to apply a deflator to company scores.  \n \nCompany assessment framework \n \nCRISIL evaluation framework comprises of 275 assessment parameters and 500+ data \npoints across E, S and G \n \nNote: The framework has been enhanced with an increase in the number of parameters assessed in fiscal 2022. \nESG score**\nEnvironmental\nSector score\nCompany score\n40%\n60%\nSocial\nSector score\nCompany score\n25%\n75%\n\u2018E\u2019 score\n\u2018S\u2019 score\nGovernance\n\u2018G\u2019 score\nCompany score\n35%\nNo sector scoring for \ngovernance since it is \ncomparable across sectors\n25%\n40%\n100%\n** On ", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

This transfer will \nbe completed by (i) transferring relevant assets, rights and obligations to the Acquiring \nCompany in the Demerger and (ii) a merger of the Acquiring Company into Yara Clean \nAmmonia Holding AS immediately after the completion of the Demerger in a triangular \nmerger, where the merger consideration will consist of an increase of the Transferring \nCompany's share capital by increasing the nominal value per share in the Transferring \nCompany (the \"Merger\"). A separate merger plan for the Merger is concluded at the same \ntime as this Demerger Plan. Following the completion of the Merger,  the intention is to \ntransfer the shares in Yara Clean Ammonia Holding AS to Yara Clean Ammonia AS, \ncompany registration no 928 652 920, in order to complete the carve-out of the YCA \nBusiness, with Yara Clean Ammonia AS as the ultimate holding company and direct \nsubsidiary of Yara International ASA.  \n1.4 \nTo enable Yara Clean Ammonia Holding AS and its subsidiaries to continue its existing \nbusiness activities following the transfer of the YCA Business, the Transferring Company \nand relevant Yara Clean Ammonia entities have entered into agreements regarding the \nprovision of services by the Yara group to the Yara Clean Ammonia group. \n1.5 \nThe Demerger and the Merger will in accordance with Oslo Stock Exchange's rules be \ncompleted outside the op", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

These circumstances have made us, as a major energy business operator, even more \naware of our mandate, namely to \u201cnever ever stop the energy supply.\u201d We have made every effort to ensure a stable \nsupply of gas and electricity. At this time of a national crisis, Tokyo Gas has served its customers as faithfully and reli-\nably as in the past.\nThe world is steadily moving toward a more sustainable society, despite being shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nIn particular, the trend toward decarbonization is accelerating, and since Prime Minister Suga declared in October 2020 \nthat Japan aims at becoming carbon neutral, widespread efforts to achieve decarbonization have begun and are gain-\ning momentum. This trend can be said to be a paradigm shift that will significantly change the economy and society. It \nis incumbent on Tokyo Gas to be alert to this and act accordingly.  \nIn November 2019, Tokyo Gas announced in its statement of its future management vision, Compass 2030, a goal \nof \u201ctaking leadership in the effort to achieve Net-Zero CO2 emissions\u201d as one of the company\u2019s management issues \nand has started to take up this challenge.\nReducing CO2 emissions during transition to Net-Zero CO2\nWe foresee several stages before reaching Net-Zero CO2. We are now in a transition period toward full energy transi-\ntion and decarbonization, during which an emphasis is assigned to the reduction of CO2 emissions. This is just a \nbeginning; we know it will be a long haul on the road to decarbonization. That journey will require innovation and large-\nscale investment extending across diverse areas and over a long time. In the near term, our emphasis is on reduction \nof CO2 emissions, and of the amount of CO2 stored in the atmosphere. Tokyo Gas considers the transition period to \nlast to around 2030, and is working on the following initiatives.\nThe first is the advanced use of natural gas. For example, we anticipate use of energy in urban redevelopment areas \nand industrial parks will be advanced by adopting smart energy network technology. We also introduce high-efficiency \ngas equipment, such as our residential-use fuel cell ENE-FARM and promote replacement of industrial fuels from heavy \noil and coal with natural gas. By doing so, our customers will be able to significantly reduce CO2 emissions.\nThe second initiative is the separation and recovery of CO2. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) and carbon \ndioxide capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), which separate, collect, and bury deep in the ground or reuse emitted \nCO2, can effectively reduce CO2 emissions without them being directly dispersed in the air.\nThe third is the expanded use of carbon neutral LNG (CNL). Inevitably, the process from the extraction of natural \ngas to its burning generates greenhouse gases, but they will be offset by CO2 emissions reduction through support of \nreforestation and other renewable projects. In March 2021, the Tokyo Gas Group established the Carbon Neutral LNG \nBuyers Alliance with 14 other companies with the aim of advancing toward a sustainable society by this third initiative. \nSpecifically, Tokyo Gas will procure and supply CNL and the Alliance companies will purchase and use it as fuel for \noffice building", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 47.0}}}}
{"task": "Quantitative ESG data extraction", "input": "SUSTAINABILITY\nOUR APPROACH TO Sustainability \neasyJet aims to be a responsible and sustainable business. We recognise the \nneed to transition to a low-carbon economy and will continue to work towards \nensuring aviation plays its part. Our focus is to pioneer positive change for our \nplanet, communities and people, getting one step closer to net zero every day. \nThe benefits of aviation are fantastic \u2013 it \nconnects people, reunites friends and \nfamilies, enables people to experience \ndifferent cultures and provides economic \nprosperity. But at the same time, we know \nthat we have a responsibility to minimise \nthe impact of our flights on the planet and \neveryone at easyJet, including myself, \ntakes this responsibility seriously. \nThere is no doubt that decarbonising \naviation is a cross-industry effort and no \none airline can do this alone, however I\u2019m \nincredibly proud of the progress that we, \nand our partners, have made this year and \nbelieve that easyJet is an industry leader on \nits journey to net zero. \nMuch has been achieved this year; in \nNovember 2021, we made an important \ncommitment by joining Race to Zero, a \nUN-backed global campaign to achieve net \nzero carbon emissions by 2050. This was \nclosely followed by setting a carbon \nemissions intensity reduction target of 35% \nby 2035 and in September 2022 we were \nthe first low-cost airline worldwide to \nannounce an interim target validated by \nthe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). \nLater in September we published our \nSBTi-aligned roadmap to achieving net \nzero carbon emissions by 2050. I firmly \nbelieve that our roadmap is the most \nambitious to date due to the focus on new \ntechnology, as soon as available, with the \nambition to achieve zero carbon emission \nflying across our entire fleet in the \nlong-term. By 2050, we plan to have \nreduced our carbon emissions per \npassenger by 78%, with residual emissions \nremoved through carbon capture \ntechnology.\nAlongside the ultimate transition to zero \ncarbon emission technology, the roadmap \nfeatures a combination of fleet renewal, \noperational efficiencies, airspace \nmodernisation, Sustainable Aviation  \nFuel and carbon removal technology  \n(see pages 12 and 13). \nWe have taken a wide range of actions to \nhelp us make progress on the roadmap. \nOn new zero emission technology, we \nformed a new partnership with Rolls-Royce \nto pioneer the development of hydrogen \ncombustion engine technology capable of \npowering an easyJet sized aircraft in the \nfuture with ground testing already \nsuccessfully underway. We formed \nhydrogen technology partnerships with \nGKN Aerospace and Cranfield Aerospace \nSolutions and were the first airline to \nsupport Airbus\u2019s ZEROe programme. \nA modern fleet of aircraft is instrumental in \ndriving down emissions and so we will be \nmaking a list price investment of $21 billion \nover the coming years to continue to \nrenew our fleet. All 168 new aircraft \ndeliveries, scheduled between FY23 and \nFY29, will be Airbus NEO aircraft, which are \nat least 15% more fuel efficient and 50% \nquieter than the aircraft they replace. \nDuring the year we also announced several \ntechnology developments, including a \nmulti-million-pound fleet-wide investment \ninto the latest technology from Airbus to \nachieve further carbon emission reduction \nthrough Descent Profile Optimisation.\nWe have contracted all Sustainable \nAviation Fuel (SAF) reflected in our \nroadmap for the next five years with \nsupplier Q8 Aviation and also signed a \nletter of intent with Airbus to support the \ndevelopment of ground-breaking carbon \nremoval technology. \nAs we move towards delivery of our net \nzero roadmap, we are transitioning our \ncurrent investment in carbon offsetting \ninto supporting the technologies that will \nhelp us decarbonise.\nLooking beyond carbon, we became the \nfirst low-cost carrier worldwide to have a \nfully-certified IATA Environmental \nAssessment (IEnvA) Environmental \nManagement System, showing we are \nmanaging our environmental performance \nin a structured and systematic way. \nWe continue to support the vital work of \nUNICEF both through its Covid-19 Vaccines \nAppeal and collecting donations to help \nsupport children and families affected by \nthe war in Ukraine. \nMeanwhile, easyJet holidays continues to \nfind ways to further optimise the benefits \nof travel and tourism to destination \ncommunities (see page 40). \nSo in summary, informed by our roadmap \nwe are investing millions where we can \nmake the most difference, in efficiency \nmeasures now and in the development and \nrealisation of net zero technology in the \ndecades to come. \nBy continuing our leadership in this area \nand implementing our roadmap step by \nstep, we will help ensure a sustainable \nfuture of aviation for the benefit of the \nnext generation and our planet.\nI\u2019m incredibly  \nproud of the  \nprogress that we,  \nand our partners,  \nhave made this year \nand believe that \neasyJet is an industry \nleader on its journey  \nto net zero.\u201d \nMESS", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "recycled_waste_percent": 51.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

And the \nM&A world is no exception to the rule.\nAcross sectors and around the world, more and more \ndeals are starting to be influenced by sustainability \ncriteria. Targets with strong sustainability stories (and \nthe data to back it up) are enjoying price premiums. \nAnd M&A teams are increasingly conducting \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) due \ndiligence (DD) on targets at an early stage. \nTo find out what this means for dealmakers across \nEurope, the Middle East and Africa, we surveyed more \nthan 150 active dealmakers across the region. We \nasked them what works, what doesn\u2019t work and what \nchallenges they face going forward. We discussed \nvarious models for embedding ESG into DD. And we \nasked them to share their advice and insights based on \ntheir experience. \nWhat we found was little consensus around what ESG \nDD actually means. Dealmakers are divided about how \nbest to incorporate ESG DD into their existing due \ndiligence frameworks. ESG DD work is often \nunderfunded. And ESG DD is not always aligned to the \norganization\u2019s overall ESG strategy. \nYet the data also suggests that dealmakers have made \nthis area a key priority. And they are determined to see \nhow ESG DD can not only help identify and manage \npotential risks, but also identify significant financial \nupside driven by ESG transformation. The importance \nof getting ESG DD right has never been clearer. \nIn this report, we explore the findings of our survey \nand one-on-one interviews with dealmakers. \nLeveraging insights gained from KPMG firms\u2019 \nexperience in ESG and due diligence, the authors offer \nsome tips and advice to help dealmakers evolve and \nmature their ESG DD capabilities. And we share some \npractical examples from KPMG firms\u2019 work in the area. \nWe hope this report provides EMA dealmakers and \nstrategy leaders with new ideas and motivation to \ndrive forward their ESG DD capabilities. To learn more \nabout the topics raised in this report \u2013 or to discuss \nyour organization\u2019s unique ESG DD situation \u2013 we \nencourage you to contact any of the KPMG \nprofessionals listed at the back of this report. \nTo find out what ESG DD \nmeans for dealmakers across \nEurope, the Middle East and \nAfrica, we surveyed more than \n150 active dealmakers across \nthe region.\n02\n2022 EMA ESG Due Diligence Study\nHow leading M&A teams are managing ESG DD\n\n\u00a9 2022 Copyright owned by one or more of the KPMG International entities. KPMG International entities provide no services to clients. All rights reserved. \nSummary of key findings\nSomething exciting is happening at the nexus of M&A and ESG. Dealmakers are actively \nintegrating ESG considerations into their deal activities. Investors across the board are ramping \nup their ESG due diligence efforts. And premiums are being paid for targets that meet ESG \npriorities. Dealmakers see the financial value and potential uplift opportunities that can be \nachieved by understanding a target\u2019s ESG-related performance at an early stage of the \ntransaction process. Read Chapter 1 to learn more.\nHowever, there are still major challenges faced by ESG DD practitioners. Specifically, \nthere appears to be no market consensus around what a standard ESG DD scope would \ninclude, as practitioners struggle with the breadth of the term \u201cESG\u201d. And targets aren\u2019t \nalways able to provide quality data or documentation. As such, practitioners can often struggle \nto quantify their findings and related financial impacts or value creation opportunities. Read \nChapter 2 to learn more.\nNonetheless, there are clear indications of \u201cwhat good looks like\u201d. Mature ESG DD \npractitioners are making a strong link between their overarching corporate sustainability \nstrategy and their ESG DD procedures. They are connecting their ESG DD findings to post-\nclosing actions. And they are focused on value creation opportunities (i.e. \u201cupsides\u201d) rather \nthan just mitigation of risks. They are also more likely to mandate a dedicated ESG DD \nworkstream, as opposed to a \u201cfragmented\u201d model where \u201cE\u201d, \u201cS\u201d, and \u201cG\u201d topics are \nhandled by separate workstreams. Financial investors appear to be somewhat ahead of the \ncurve in terms of ESG DD maturity. Read Chapter 3 to learn more.\nThe immediate priorities for dealmakers are becoming clear. First, dealmakers need to \nunderstand their company\u2019s ESG strategy and identify the areas that are truly material. This \ncan help them break through the complexity caused by the breadth of the term \u2018ESG\u2019. Second, \nthey need to develop a \u201cblueprint\u201d for their ESG DD approach, both in terms of intellectual \nframework as well as in terms of organization (dedic", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 0.0}}}}

It\u2019s within this context that we are pleased to \nlaunch KPMG\u2019s inaugural ESG Assurance Maturity Index, developed to help inform \ncompanies, investors and wider stakeholders on the current landscape. It comes \nat a pivotal time, as companies globally undertake a critical journey to prepare for \nnew ESG regulatory requirements.\nMost companies are already doing some reporting \non ESG topics, primarily on a voluntary basis. But \nnow the rules and market demands are changing, \nand what was once done at a company\u2019s \ndiscretion is now becoming mandatory and \nsubject to independent third-party assurance. \nTime is of the essence as sustainability reporting \nframeworks come into force.1\nTo gain investor and stakeholder confidence and \nmitigate the risk of greenwashing, ESG reporting \nshould be subject to a level of scrutiny \ncomparable to the financial information that users \ndepend on. This means that companies need to \ninvest in and improve data quality by applying \ndisclosure control and risk frameworks akin to \nthose used in financial reporting.\nThe impending regulatory requirements are \nunquestionably driving the urgency to become \nready for ESG assurance, but that is just part of \nthe story. As our Index and research show, the \npotential benefits to becoming assurance ready go \nbeyond mere compliance. Stakeholders from \ninvestors to employees to society as a whole \nwant to know more about how companies are \noperating in a sustainable way. This has been the \nimpetus for the regulatory action but assuring ESG \ndata can more broadly contribute to a company\u2019s \nreputation. The rigor and processes required to \nobtain ESG assurance can improve operations \nthrough accurate insights for decision-making, risk \nmanagement and efficiency gains. \nThe KPMG ESG Assurance Maturity Index and \nassociated research are designed to offer a path \nforward and provide a roadmap with guidance on \nareas to focus on, and the steps to take to \nbecome ready for ESG assurance. \nKPMG professionals are right there on the journey \nwith you. We are operationalizing ESG across our \nglobal organization to ensure our KPMG firms\u2019 \nESG assurance work is performed to the same \nconsistent level of rigor and quality as our financial \naudit activities and benefits from the same \nadvanced technology platform.

As a result, \ncompanies are increasingly reporting on non-\nfinancial information in their annual reports and suite \nof ESG reporting. ESG is now a Board level issue for \nmany companies in the UK. There is also an \nexpectation on financial statement auditors to \nperform additional procedures on the front half of \naccounts, and management are looking to ESG \nreporting to convey strategy, meet public \nexpectations, and help to manage risk. Lenders \nfocus on reporting to inform credit availability, and \ninvestors use ESG reporting to inform capital \nallocation decisions, risk premiums, and to assess if \na firm suits their investment mandate or strategy. \nFinally, regulators are showing increasing interest \nthrough requirements under the UK Companies Act, \nthe Taskforce for Climate Related Financial \nDisclosures, the Department for Business, Energy \nand Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and EU Requirements. \nKPMG are experts in delivering a number of \ndifferent types of ESG assurance to help companies \nbuild confidence in their ESG reporting within this \nchanging landscape, with over 50 KPMG member \nfirms in our global network offering specialist \nknowledge and understanding of the complexity of \ndiverse regulatory frameworks.

We describe below the general reporting \nmethodologies and boundaries related to both \nnon-environmental and environmental reporting. \nWhere there are exceptions to these general \nreporting methodologies and boundaries, these \nhave been included with the specific metric in \nthe tables that follow.\nGeneral reporting methodology and \nboundaries,\u00a0covering both non-environmental \nand environmental metric reporting\nI. Reporting period\nOur reporting covers the financial year ended 30 June 2023 unless \notherwise stated.\nII. Scope\nUnless otherwise stated1, the boundaries for all non-financial \ninformation disclosed in the Annual Report and the ESG Reporting \nIndex include the performance of the global operations of Diageo plc \nand its subsidiaries, together with the attributable share of the results \nof significant joint ventures and joint operations. \nThe reporting boundaries are based on the principles outlined by \nthe\u00a0non-financial reporting strategy of our management, the nature \nof each indicator and, in the case of our greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions metrics, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. \nEnvironmental data and health and safety data is collected and \nreported for all operational sites and office sites with more than 50 \nemployees where we have operational control. The environmental \nimpacts associated with leased facilities that do not meet the criteria \nalready mentioned are excluded and considered immaterial to the \ncompany\u2019s overall impacts. This scope is reviewed every year to \nassess the data and extent of impacts. \nGHG emissions associated with leased vehicles under operational \ncontrol are being reviewed and reassessed to determine material \nsignificance to overall emissions and extent of overlap with Scope 3 \nindirect emissions. This review will be concluded in fiscal 24; our \ncurrent estimate indicates leased vehicles may contribute 4%-5% \nof\u00a0Scope 1 emissions or <0.5% of Scope 3 emissions.\nMaterial changes to environmental reporting methodologies are \nratified at quarterly 2030 grain-to-glass Strategic Business Review \nmeetings, chaired by the President, Global Supply Chain & \nProcurement and Chief Sustainability Officer.\nExceptions to and limitations of each indicator are explained in the \nfollowing pages of this document. \nIII. Baseline and targets\nThe financial year ended 30 June 2020 is our baseline year. \nIt\u00a0applies\u00a0to the majority of our \u2018Society 2030: Spirit of Progress\u2018 goals. \nExceptions are described in the following pages. The baseline data \nis\u00a0used as the basis for calculating progress against our goals.\nWe aim to achieve each goal by fiscal 30, unless otherwise stated \nin\u00a0the following pages of this document. \nIV. Acquisitions and disposals\nNew acquisitions are included in the consolidated reporting for \nnon-financial disclosure from the date when control passes or \nas\u00a0soon\u00a0as practically feasible, and no later than one year after \nassuming operational control.2 This duration varies as each \nnew\u00a0acquisition has unique systems and processes that must be \nintegrated. In case of disposals, data associated with the divestment \nis removed from the baseline, intervening years and current year \nunless otherwise stated in the following pages.\nV. Restatements\nWe may have to restate historical data due to structural changes \nin\u00a0our operations, including from acquisitions and divestments; \nimprovements in data accuracy and calculation methodologies; \nmaterial changes to relevant policies; and material changes in our \nnon-financial reporting.\nTo determine whether we need to restate historical data, we examine \nwhether the qualitative or quantitative impacts of the changes to our \nnon-financial reporting are material enough to compromise the \naccuracy, consistency and relevance of the reported information. \nIn\u00a0case a restatement for environmental data is necessary, we restate \nthe data for the baseline year and intervening years.\nIn case of our environmental data, we may need to adjust data to \nreflect updates to GHG emission factors, in line with the GHG Protocol \nrecommendations; and any changes in reporting policy that result in \na\u00a0material change to the baseline of more than 1%.

{"task": "Quantitative ESG data extraction", "input": " \n \n \nKEY CONSIDERATIONS ON ESG DISCLOSURE POLICY \nDESIGN FOR CHINA \nINTRODUCTION \nThe United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is the world\u2019s leading \ninitiative on responsible investment. The PRI has over 2500 signatories (pension funds, insurers, \ninvestment managers and service providers) globally with approximately US $85 trillion in assets \nunder management.  \nResponsible investment explicitly acknowledges the relevance to the investor of environmental, \nsocial and governance (ESG) factors in investment decision-making for the long-term health and \nstability of financial markets.  \nABOUT THIS BRIEFING \nThis briefing provides technical guidance as part of the PRI\u2019s work on ESG disclosure in China, with \nsupport from the UK China PACT Programme. It is based on the research and recommendations of the \nreport ESG Data in China: Recommendations on Primary ESG indicators. This research showed that \nwhile there was broad alignment between international and Chinese corporate environmental, social \nand governance (ESG) data disclosure practices, the disclosures being provided by Chinese companies \nare not standardised and not readily comparable across markets, industries and portfolios. The report \ncommented that this lack of comparability limits investors\u2019 ability to integrate ESG data into their \ninvestment decisions, and acts as a barrier to increased investment in green and sustainable assets.  \nThe report therefore recommended that Chinese financial regulators introduce a mandatory \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure framework, requiring all major companies to \nreport on a series of standard ESG indicators and to supplement these quantitative metrics with \nrelated information on governance, strategy and risk management. \nIn addition to this report, PRI was asked by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to \nprovide guidance on the specific regulations or regulatory clauses that would be required to \nimplement these recommendations. \nThis briefing is the PRI\u2019s response to that request. It identifies the key questions and considerations \nthat would need to be addressed by any regulator seeking to introduce corporate ESG disclosure \nrequirements. It also recommends draft wording that could be adopted for Chinese legislation on \ncorporate ESG reporting. \nWhile this briefing has been informed by our work on similar legislations in other jurisdictions, there \nis not yet a single \u2018best practice\u2019 ESG disclosure legislation. Different countries have taken different \napproaches depending on their specific contexts, e.g. the maturity of ESG or sustainability reporting \n\nESG Disclosure policy \u2013 Key considerations on policy design for China \n2 \n \nin the domestic market, national environmental, social and economic priorities, pre-existing reporting \nrequirements such as industry codes or stock exchange disclosure requirements, the needs and \ninterests of investors. Current efforts of international organisations and industry stakeholders, \nincluding PRI and ICGN\u2019s project on Meaningful Data, aim to establish global, standardised and \ncomparable corporate ESG reporting. The CSRC should therefore ensure that the disclosure policy they \nput in place could be re-aligned with any future global standardised ESG disclosure recommendations. \nThis note focuses on overarching implementing legislation. In jurisdictions where similar regulation \nhas been adopted, it has tended to be supplemented by more detailed guidance over time, covering \naspects such as calculation methodologies and reporting formats. Such materials, while important, fall \noutside the scope of this briefing. \n \n \n\nESG Disclosure policy \u2013 Key considerations on policy design for China \n3 \n \nKEY CONSIDERATIONS ON ESG DISCLOSURE POLICY IN CHINA \nWhen designing legislation on mandatory ESG reporting requirements, policymakers need to start by \nanswering a number of important questions. We set these questions out below together with some \nreflections on the factors that Chinese regulators need to consider when implementing an ESG \ndisclosure requirement for companies. \n \nKey Question 1: Rationale \nWhat is the purpose of the legislation? \nThese objectives will define the specific data and information to be reported, and will define the companies \nthat are expected to report. \nThe reasons for introducing mandatory ESG disclosure requirements can include some or all of: providing \nbetter information to investors, providing information to other stakeholders, encouraging and enabling \nbetter corporate oversight and management of sustainability-related issues, and increasing investment in \ngreen and sustainable assets. \nProposed implementation for China \nAs discussed in the ESG Data in China: Recommendations for Primary ESG Indicators, in order to provide \nusable and comparable ESG data to investors, companies should be required to report on a standardised set \nof primary ESG disclosure indicators. \nMore generally, the", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

In \naddition to national and local governments, many companies also set \ntargets for emission reductions. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the \nuptake of digitalization at a much faster pace than predicted, which led to \nsignificant changes for business and in the daily lifestyles and attitudes of \npeople. \nFor corporations to survive, it is evident that they must contribute to \nenhanced sustainability for society while bolstering their own resilience in \nthe face of rapid global transformations and an uncertain future. I believe it \nis essential to consider the interests of all stakeholders and adopt a \nmanagement approach that takes a long-term perspective on both societal \nsustainability and the economic realities of business operations. \nLast year we announced that the purpose of the Fujitsu Group was \u201cto make \nthe world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation\u201d. \nOur focus now is on purpose-driven management, in which all corporate \nactivities are oriented toward achieving that purpose. Fujitsu is undergoing \na comprehensive transformation, in both the financial and non-financial \nspheres, which encompasses our business portfolios, personnel and \nevaluation frameworks, organization, and corporate culture. \nFrom a financial perspective, we must address issues that will help to create \na sustainable society while also ensuring our competitive advantage as a \ntechnology company. We have therefore defined seven key focus areas in \nour \u2018For Growth\u2019 domain and will concentrate future investments in these \nareas to boost sustainability for our customers and society and to drive \nFujitsu\u2019s continued growth. On the non-financial front, we are determined \nto transform our organizational culture by involving all Fujitsu Group \nemployees in the Fujitra Project \u2013 our in-house digital transformation (DX) \ninitiative. With the aim of developing businesses that take into account the interests of all stakeholders, we established a Global \nResponsible Business (GRB) framework that covers issues such as human rights, diversity and inclusion; wellbeing; the \nenvironment; and responsible procurement in the supply chain. As part of the GRB, we have outlined what Fujitsu aspires to be \nand have set goals for our various activities. One of these is a downward revision of the overall Fujitsu Group target for reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, in line with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u2103, as we work to assist our customers and \nsociety in general on the path to carbon neutrality. \n \nTo measure the progress of Fujitsu\u2019s internal transformation efforts, in 2020 we introduced a range of non-financial indicators to \ncomplement the existing financial indicators. These additional management checks are designed to monitor the levels of trust \nshown by customers and employees and to track the progress of our in-house DX initiative. We are now working on a method for \nvisualizing the relationships between the financial and non-financial indicators, and also between the non-financial indicators \nand the GRB. Fujitsu is committed to data-driven management that uses forecasts derived by analyzing data on the company\u2019s \ngrowth, the contribution to enhanced sustainability for customers and society, and the company\u2019s internal transformation, as \nwell as by analyzing the relationships between these various data elements. In this way, we will advance toward achieving our \ncorporate purpose. \nTakin", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 75.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

This report has been produced by the finance community for the finance community. \nNuclear Energy: An ESG Investible Asset Class has been developed from the discussions of the Taskforce, all of \nwhom are listed in Appendix III of this report. The report could not have been produced without their valuable \ncontributions, and the contribution and oversight of Fiona Reilly, Co-Chair of the EMWG and Chair of the Taskforce. \nGIF would also like to express its gratitude to the Nuclear Industry Association in the United Kingdom, the Canadian \nNuclear Association, the Nuclear Energy Institute in the United States, Natural Resources Canada, and the Nuclear \nInnovation and Research Office and the National Nuclear Laboratory in the United Kingdom.  \nScope of the Report \nThis report has various sections: \n\u2022 \nClimate Financing and Responsible Investment: Sets out the international policy framework and \nbackground around climate finance including the UN\u2019s Principles of Responsible Investment, the rise of \nESG reporting and its role in accessing climate finance and the role of taxonomies and how they fit, or \nrather do not fit, with ESG reporting; \n\u2022 \nLow Carbon ESG Reporting: Provides a very high-level overview of how low carbon energy companies \nand/or projects could report against ESG; \n\u2022 \nNuclear Disclosures Against ESG: Demonstrates the nuclear industry\u2019s ability to report against ESG and \nwhy it is an investable asset class, if projects and companies are established and managed well;  \n\u2022 \nAppendix I Standard Metrics:  The Taskforce mapped the WEF ESG against relevant SASB and TCFD ESG \nto create a consolidated list of ESG, which are used in this report; and \n\u2022 \nAppendix II Consistent and Transparent Reporting: Provides significantly more details and cross-\nreferences for the finance community and wider stakeholders to use when considering nuclear companies \nand projects reporting together with some analysis where other energy companies could follow the \nnuclear industry\u2019s lead in their ability to report against ESG.  \nIt is hoped, and intended, that this report develops into a living document that is used by the finance industry as a \nreference and guide to use when considering nuclear companies and their assets. \n \n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nNUCLEAR ENERGY: AN ESG INVESTABLE ASSET CLASS, GIF 2021 \n5 \nTable of contents \nNuclear Energy: An ESG Investable Asset Class .................................................................................................... 1 \nForeword ............................................................................................................................................................ 3 \nScope of the Report ............................................................................................................................................ 3 \nTable of contents ................................................................................................................................................ 5 \nList of abbreviations and acronyms ..................................................................................................................... 7 \nExecutive summary ........................................................................................................................................... 11 \nGovernance ........................................................................................................................................................... 12 \nPlanet .................................................................................................................................................................... 13 \nPeople ................................................................................................................................................................... 13 \nProsperity .............................................................................................................................................................. 14 \nReferences ............................................................................................................................................................. 15 \nIntroduction and background ............................................................................................................................ 17 \nNuclear and renewable", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 39.0}}}}

This report \nintends to provide transparency on how we assess \nthe environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nperformance of companies we invest in, how we \nengaged with leadership and insights from our research \nduring the year. Through reporting on our approach \nto ESG, we want to communicate how we integrate \nresponsible investment principles into our investment \napproach. \nCountries across the world are grappling with issues \nsuch as climate change mitigation, climate change \nadaption, energy security, reliability and affordability. \nWe recognise these issues are complex and will require \na wide range of financial and technology solutions. In \nparticular, global listed infrastructure companies will be \nat the forefront of the global energy transition and will \nplay an integral part in achieving net zero emissions. \nAs long-term and active investors, we know that the \ninvestment decisions we make today will impact future \ngenerations. We take an active approach to proxy \nvoting to convey our views to boards and management \non important topics including board composition, \nremuneration packages and climate transition plans.\nThrough company engagement we seek to better \nunderstand risk in our portfolio, suggest areas for \nimprovement, increase transparency on ESG issues, \nand support companies that are making progress in \nthis area. We typically engage companies on material \nissues to achieve specific outcomes. More broadly, we \nparticipate in industry groups such as Climate Action \n100+ to push for change on complex issues such as \nenergy transition and the pathway towards net zero. \nAligning with FSI\u2019s firm-wide commitment, we are \ncommitted to building investment portfolios with a \ntarget of net zero by 2050 and are pursuing interim \ntargets by 2030 to reduce the Weighted Average \nCarbon Intensity of our investment portfolios1.  We will \nseek to prioritise the direction of capital to infrastructure \ncompanies that are aligned or aligning with a pathway to \nnet zero by 2050 and encourage the investment of this \ncapital into real assets that reduce absolute emissions. \nAs stewards of our clients\u2019 capital, we will continue to \nengage with companies on these issues with a view to \ndelivering more sustainable risk adjusted returns.\n1.\t\nThe team\u2019s net zero target applies to all Global Listed Infrastructure and Responsible Listed Infrastructure pooled vehicles, and to separate client accounts that are subject to equivalent \ninvestment guidelines.\nImportant Information\nThis material contains measurements and data relating to ESG factors and metrics, together with specific ESG related commitments and targets. \nThe measurements and data relating to ESG factors and metrics are estimates based on information sourced by the relevant investment team from third parties including portfolio companies and \nsuch information may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nThese commitments or targets are current as at the date of publication and have been formulated by the relevant investment team in accordance with either internally developed proprietary \nframeworks or are otherwise based on the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) Paris Aligned Investment Initiative framework. The commitments and targets are based on \ninformation and representations made to the relevant investment teams by portfolio companies (which may ultimately prove not be accurate), together with assumptions made by the relevant \ninvestment team in relation to future matters such as government policy implementation in ESG and other climate-related areas, enhanced future technology and the actions of portfolio \ncompanies (all of which are subject to change over time). As such, achievement of these commitments and targets depend on the ongoing accuracy of such information and representations as \nwell as the realisation of such future matters. \nAny commitments and targets set out in this material are continuously reviewed by the relevant investment teams and subject to change without notice.\n\n5\nFirst Sentier Investors  |  Global Listed Infrastructure 2022 Sustainability Report\nOur approach\nESG issues are fundamental to infrastructure \ncompanies, given they have significant service \nobligations and moral accountability to the communities \nin which they operate.

For more \nthan two decades, we have been committed to \nimproving human health by unlocking the power of \nthe genome. Yet today, the need is more urgent than \never to help build a healthier, more sustainable world \nwhere all people can thrive. \nGenomics has the ability to improve global health \ncare, sustainability, and equity through better \ndiagnosis and treatment; better representation \nin genomic data; greater access to personalized \nmedicine; and a deeper understanding of the world. \nThis is the genome era, and the last few years \nhave shown the promise that exists around us.\nGenomics enables the world to act quickly and \nmitigate the spread of infectious diseases. \nThe world\u2019s first mRNA vaccine roll-out ignited a \nwildfire of genomic innovation and breakthroughs \nthat will improve human health beyond the pandemic. \nThere will always be new pathogens, but what \nmatters is our ability to identify and control their \nspread. Effective global surveillance, backed by \ncollaboration and adoption, can prevent the next \npathogenic outbreak from becoming another \nglobal pandemic. \u00a0\nGenomics is transforming personalized \nmedicine and saving lives. The science is being \napplied to every step of cancer care and reducing \nthe diagnostic odyssey for those suffering from rare \ngenetic diseases. Revolutionary therapies are hitting \nthe clinic and reinventing how we fight an expanding \nnumber of conditions. \nGenomic data has become the blueprint for \neverything from diagnostics to precision \ntherapeutics.

The ongoing COVID-19 health crisis is \ndriving an exponential expansion of our digital footprint. While this is bringing \nunprecedented conveniences into our lives and interactions, it is by no means \nequitable or sustainable.\nThe environmental challenges posed by this eruption are staggering. \nFrom high energy consumption and carbon emissions to burgeoning digital \nwaste and unrestrained extraction of rare earth minerals and precious metals \nlike cobalt for hardware, the price we are paying for digital progress \nis exorbitant.\nWhat\u2019s making matters worse is that its benefits are not fairly shared. \nAffluent citizens, corporates and countries with greater access to digital \nlearning and skills, infrastructure and data stand to gain the most. The gap \nis widening for those entities with lesser digital resilience and bridging it is \nbecoming more challenging every day.\nEven as the ubiquity of digital grows, citizens lack a holistic understanding \nof issues around digital media engagement and protection of personal data. \nThere is a lot of ground to be covered in terms of education and standards.\nAt Infosys, we are deeply invested in reimagining \nour digital future into a shared reality that \neveryone can adapt to with ease, and benefit \nfrom equitably. Our ESG Vision 2030 focuses \non shaping and sharing solutions to tackle this \nglobal challenge.

This includes maintaining robust risk, financial and operating controls; having an unwavering \ndevotion to our customers and communities; investing in our employees and fostering a diverse and inclusive \nworkplace; upholding a culture that reinforces integrity, fairness and responsibility; and advancing sustainability in \nour business and operations. \nWe also continually challenge ourselves to find ways to put our business to work for the benefit of all of our \nstakeholders, including those who are struggling the most. That is why we\u2019re fully engaged in trying to help solve \nsome of the world\u2019s biggest challenges \u2014 including racial inequality, climate change and the need to advance an \ninclusive economic recovery.  \nToday, this is frequently described as environmental, social and governance \u2014 or ESG \u2014 management. I think of it \nsimply as the smart way to do business. \nOur firm\u2019s strategy to help accelerate the shift to a more sustainable, low-carbon future is one example of our work in \naction. We are targeting to finance and facilitate more than $2.5 trillion over 10 years to advance climate action and \nsustainable development. In addition, we are aligning key financing portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement \nand working with our clients to finance their decarbonization strategies \u2014 efforts that are intended to drive near-term \nactions that will help set the world on a path to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. \nWe also committed $30 billion to advance racial equity. Structural barriers in the U.S. have created profound racial \ninequities, which the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated. JPMorgan Chase is working to do our part by harnessing \nour expertise in business, policy and philanthropy to address key drivers of the racial wealth divide and provide \neconomic opportunity to underserved communities, especially Black and Latinx communities. We are also redoubling \nour efforts to build a more equitable and representative workforce within our own company.\nUltimately, our long-term business success depends on the success of the communities we serve. In this report, I \ninvite you to learn more about the ways we strive to operate a thriving company that we can be proud of, and all the \nways JPMorgan Chase is putting its business to work for our stakeholders. \nJamie Dimon\nChairman & CEO, JPMorgan\u00a0Chase\u00a0&\u00a0Co.\n3\n2020 Environmental, Social & Governance Report\n\nOur Approach to ESG\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cJPMorgan Chase,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cthe firm\u201d) has built its reputation on \nbeing there for our clients, customers and communities. The events of 2020 \u2014 the global COVID-19 pandemic, a societal \nreckoning with systemic racism and the increasingly visible effects of climate change \u2014 underscore why understanding, \nanticipating and effectively managing environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters is critical to delivering on \nour mission to serve our clients, customers and communities. Now, more than ever, a strong focus on ESG is a business \nimperative \u2014 and a key driver of long-term business success. \nAt JPMorgan Chase, ESG matters are an important consideration in how we do business, including our corporate governance systems, risk \nmanagement and controls, human capital management, approach to serving clients and customers, support for local communities and \nmanagement of our physical operations. We recognize the potential for ESG-related risks, which we work to identify and manage just as we \nmanage risk in all areas of our business. Equally important, we believe companies like ours have an obligation to put their businesses to work \nfor all of their stakeholders. For our firm, this means we are leveraging our business and policy expertise, data, capital and global presence to \nhelp drive an inclusive recovery, expand access to economic opportunity and accelerate sustainability", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

That is why our company is beginning to \nimplement ambitious targets and commitments to help drive equity and create a \nmore resilient world.\nA responsible approach to energy and climate, especially during a time of war, is to \nimmediately help provide energy security around the globe while remaining focused \non accelerating the development of affordable, reliable and lower-carbon energy \nsolutions. We have a goal to reduce the carbon intensity of our financing portfolios, \nstarting with oil & gas, electric power and automotive manufacturing, and targeting \n$1 trillion by 2030 \u2013 as part of an overall $2.5 trillion sustainable development \ntarget \u2013 to advance renewable energy and other innovative technologies. And we \nare minimizing the environmental impact of our physical operations across \nthousands of branches, as well as our data centers and corporate offices. \nWe are also making progress in implementing our $30 billion commitment to help \nclose the racial wealth gap. Financing affordable places for people to live, expanding \naccess to services through local community branches, and supporting Minority \nDepository Institutions and Community Development Financial Institutions are a few \nexamples of how we\u2019re putting this commitment to work. Because racial equity, like \nclimate, requires a coordinated government response, we are advocating for policies \nthat diversify the appraisal industry, help Americans with no credit file gain access \nto credit and provide access to affordable small business loans.\nFinally, we can only run a strong company and tackle these challenges if we have \nexemplary people. I am so proud of how hard our employees have worked through \nthese tough times and the continued steps we\u2019ve taken to cultivate a diverse and \ninclusive workplace and support our customers and communities. \nThere is no doubt we \u2013 both as a company and society \u2013 have a long way to go. We \nmay not get it right every time, but we strive every day to do the right thing. \nMoments of crisis are also moments of opportunity.

We took swift action to protect our teams at the \noutset of the COVID-19 pandemic to keep our people and \ntheir families safe and healthy. We prioritized care for our \nemployees so we could provide the essential products that \nthe world was counting on. \nAs the world's focus expanded beyond the pandemic to \ninclude social and racial injustice, our values dictated how \nwe would use the strength of our culture and trusted brands \nto advocate for and promote inclusion, drive diversity, and \ndisrupt bias - at first with our employees around the world, \nand later in the communities where we live and work.  \nThese once-in-a-lifetime events forced us to both embrace \nand redefine how we care for each other, our customers, \nour consumers, our communities, and our planet, and they \naffirmed a shared purpose for our company that was not fully \nrealized until the pandemic required a singular focus on care.\nThis sense of purpose is at the core of our ambitious \nsustainability strategy, which we introduced last year: to uplift \nthe lives and well-being of 1 billion people around the world \nby 2030, with half the environmental footprint in the areas \nwhere we can make the biggest difference \u2013 climate, forests, \nwater, and plastics.\nWe know the hard work is still ahead of us. Yet, the \nconversation around sustainability is changing, and growing \nfor good means that we must be bolder and act faster to \naddress the social and environmental challenges facing our \nconsumers, our communities, and the planet. In setting these \ngoals for ourselves, we believe we are futureproofing our \nbusiness for generations to come.\nThis year\u2019s report showcases the incredible response from our \nteams to an extraordinary year, and it reflects how we live our \npurpose every day.\nMike Hsu  \nChairman, CEO, and Proud Employee  \nKimberly-Clark\nOur Strategy for the \nDecisive Decade\nOur Business \nin 2020\nMaking  \nLives Better\nSmallest Environmental \nFootprint \nLeadership \nMessage \nLeadership \nMessage \nA Message from Mike Hsu\nA Message from Lisa Morden\n\nThe Essentials for a Safer, \nHealthier World \nThe past year presented previously unimaginable \nchallenges that put health and safety at the forefront \nwhile illuminating social and environmental gaps \nthat still need to be bridged.

This 2022 report follows the International Integrated \nReporting Council (IIRC) framework, explaining how we create \nvalue for our stakeholders and society, and in relation to our \nambitions, sense of purpose and goals.\nOur stakeholders include all the individuals and organizations \naffected by our operations or with whom we have a relationship. \nThey include, but are not limited to, enterprise, residential \nand wholesale customers, investors, employees, political and \nregulatory stakeholders, suppliers, partners, journalists and \nopinion leaders.\nThe scope of the information in this report covers Proximus Group, \nunless stated otherwise. Proximus Group comprises Proximus \nSA, its subsidiaries, as well as the Group\u2019s interest in associates \nand joint ventures accounted for under the equity method and \njoint operations. We refer you to Note 8 (p.242) for the list of \nsubsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and joint operations. \nProximus SA is a \u201cLimited Liability Company of Public Law\u201d, \nregistered in Belgium.\nThe purpose of this report is to inform our stakeholders about our \nrole in society. We outline our corporate strategy and the progress \nwe have made in achieving our goals, while making the link to our \nmost material topics. This report also contains the full financial, \nenvironmental, social and governance statements and notes. \nThe Audit and Compliance Committee assists and advises the \nBoard of Directors in its oversight of the efficiency of the systems \nfor internal control and risk management of the company, of the \nexternal auditors\u2019 work and of the compliance with policies, legal \nand regulatory requirements. \nThe report has been prepared in accordance with the EU Directive \non disclosure of non-financial and diversity information and SASB \n(Sustainability Accounting Standards Board). \nIt has also been prepared in reference to the GRI (Global \nReporting Initiative) Standards  \n.

In the future, Proximus intends to \nperform such an analysis. \nSince its Annual Report of 2021, Proximus is integrating the \nrecommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosure) to emphasize its efforts in identifying and \nmitigating climate-related risks and opportunities  \n. We will \ncontinue to integrate TCFD recommendations in the coming years. \nProximus also reports against the EU Taxonomy Regulations  \n. \nEvery year, Proximus completes questionnaires from ESG rating \nagencies such as CDP, Sustainalytics, Ecovadis and S&P.

We are upgrading \nour technology infrastructure; \naugmenting our artificial \nintelligence, robotics and \nautomation expertise; \nrenovating and building new \nfacilities; and continually adding \nnew talent across our organization.  \nI am proud of our team\u2019s ability to balance our \nfocus on near-term performance with the drive to \nbuild a foundation for future growth. \nIn this context, I am pleased to present Ranpak\u2019s \n2021 ESG Impact Report.  I invite you to read on \nand see the continued progress we have made on \nESG matters.  While this is our third ESG report, \nit is our first report since announcing long-term \nenvironmental targets last year.  And it is with \nrespect to our progress towards our targets that I \nam especially proud.  Specifically:\n\t\u203a 100% FSC\u00ae-CERTIFIED PRODUCT BY 2030.  In \n2021, 62% of the paper packaging material we sold \nwas FSC\u00ae-certified, up from only 3% in 2020.   \n\t\u203a 75% RECYCLED CONTENT (PIW & PCW) BY \n2030. In 2021, 60% of the pulp used to manufacture \nour paper supply was recycled content, up from \n55% in 2020.  \n\t\u203a 25% POST-CONSUMER WASTE (PCW) BY 2030.  \nIn 2021, we surpassed this target, with 38% of the \npulp used to manufacture our paper supply being \nPCW, up from 17% in 2020.  \n\t\u203a 46% REDUCTION IN GHG EMISSIONS BY \n2030. In 2021, our combined scope 1 and scope \n2 greenhouse gas emissions increased by \napproximately 12% from 2020, but decreased by 2% \nfrom 2019, the last year unaffected by COVID.    \nAs these results show, we made tremendous \nprogress on our FSC\u00ae-Certification and Recycled \nContent targets \u2013 and surpassed our Post-\nConsumer Waste target.  Substantially all of our \nPCW gains reflect our paper suppliers\u2019 increased \nuse of PCW as an ingredient in the paper we \nsource, a trend we hope will continue in 2022.  \nNevertheless, our engineering and product \nmanagement teams will continue to work hard \nto qualify additional papers \u2013 with more recycled \nand PCW content \u2013 for additional packaging \napplications.  \nAdditionally, we are making investments today that \nwill significantly reduce our emissions in the future. \nOur renovation and construction projects in Ohio, \nthe Netherlands and Connecticut all incorporate \ndesign elements that will make them more efficient, \nand therefore, more sustainable.  We have also \nalready begun the process of designing solar-power \ngeneration systems in Ohio and the Netherlands. \nTherefore, although our greenhouse gas emissions \nhave remained relatively unchanged from 2019 (with \na significant dip in 2020 due to COVID), we are \nconfident these investments will result in reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2023.\nAs a result, today, Ranpak is stronger than ever.  \nWe remain a business of approximately 850 \nglobal employees pushing the use cases and \neffectiveness of sustainable packaging further than \npreviously imaginable and wholly committed to \ndelivering a better world in everything that we do. \nOmar Asali | Chairman & CEO\n2021 ESG Impact Report\nOVERVIEW\nENVIRONMENT\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\nAPPENDIX\n\nTable of Contents\nOverview\n2\t Our Mission\n4\t Highlights\n6\t Innovation\n7\t Investment\n8\t \u0007Renovation & \nExpansion\n9\t \u0007Climate  \nResponsibility\nEnvironment\n10\t \u0007The Circular Economy\n11\t \u0007UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals\n12\t Sourcing\n16\t Water\n17\t Energy & Emissions\n20\tWaste Management \n22\tMachine Assembly\nSocial\n23\tStakeholders\n26\tCulture\n28\t\u0007Diversity & Inclusion \n29\tEmployee Focus\n30\tPay & Benefits\n31\t Safety\nGovernance\n32\tBoard\n33\tManagement\n34\tEthics\n35\t\u0007Risk Management\nAppendix\n36\t\u0007Additional Information \n37\tAbout This Report\n38\t\u0007GRI & SASB Content \nIndex\n41\t \u00072021 ESG \nPerformance \nSummary\n2021 ESG Impact Report\n1\nOVERVIEW\nENVIRONMENT\nSOCIAL\nGOVERNANCE\nAPPENDIX\n\nOUR MISSION: To Deliver a Better World \u2122\nDeliver a Better World is \nmore than a motto.

These opportunities are fueled by major \nsecular growth trends existing in Digitalization, Renewable Energy and the Energy \nTransition. For REC Silicon this is further enhanced by concerns around supply security and \nembedded competence that is driving major efforts towards re-shoring industries that \nwhere first developed and commercialized in the United States, such as Photovoltaics and \nSemiconductors. Along with underlying growth trends, the Investment Reduction Act, Chips \nAct and the Infrastructure Act all create clear pathways for us to run our current assets \ntowards full utilization as well as expand in areas where we have strong and distinct \npositions. As the largest producer of Silane and High Purity Granular outside of China and \nthe only one located in the United States, our entire production asset and product portfolio \nis uniquely positioned to translate these circumstances into further value for our \nshareholders. Simply put, we have the right assets, the right products at the right time and \nin the right place.\nSupport for the long-term success of the company was solidified in \n2022 as a result of the purchase by Hanwha Solutions and its affiliate \nHanwha Corporation of Aker Horizon\u2019s interest in REC Silicon along \nwith an additional share offering from the company as Hanwha became \nthe largest shareholder at 33.33%. REC Silicon\u2019s Board of Directors \nalso changed to the current Board comprised of Mr. Tae Won JUN as \nchair and Mr. Dong Kwan KIM as deputy chair both of whom are \naffiliated with Hanwha, along with Ms. Paraskevi (Vivian) Bertseka,  \nDr. Renate Oberhoffer-Fritz, and Ms. Roberta Benedetti as \nindependent Board members. \nIn 2022, REC Silicon announced the restart of the Moses Lake facility on \nthe heels of offtake opportunities to sell the production from the facility \nto Hanwha. Favorable governmental initiatives such as the Inflation \nReduction Act, which included SEMA has provided incentives to support \nthe reshoring of the PV industry within the United States that will also \ngreatly enhance REC Silicon\u2019s current and future prospects at Moses Lake. \nMoreover, the CHIPS Act is also expected to positively contribute to the \nsuccess at Butte as the Semiconductor industry continues its path \ntowards reshoring to the United States as well. Additional improvement \nand expansion opportunities for high value products manufactured at the \nButte facility, such as DCS, were identified and are now being implemented \nso that the Butte facility will continue to take advantage of market \nopportunities that are rapidly developing. \nAlthough the long-term prospects for REC Silicon have never been \nbrighter, there has also been some short-term challenges facing the \ncompany.

Voordat een \ngeneesmiddel een handelsvergunning krijgt en op de markt mag worden \ngebracht, moet eerst worden aangetoond dat de kwaliteit, veiligheid en \nwerkzaamheid voldoende zijn. Dit is geen eenmalige gebeurtenis maar gebeurt \ncontinu gedurende de tijd dat het geneesmiddel op de markt is. De maatregelen \ndie hiervoor nodig zijn, zijn erg omvangrijk geworden en hebben effect op \ninnovatie, kosten en de beschikbaarheid van geneesmiddelen. Daardoor leeft \nzowel binnen de overheid als de maatschappij de vraag of dit systeem \ntoekomstbestendig is. \n \nHet RIVM heeft daarom de knelpunten van het huidige systeem in kaart \ngebracht. Het blijkt dat de vier belangrijke thema\u2019s van het systeem (veiligheid \n& effectiviteit, kosten, innovatie en beschikbaarheid) nauw met elkaar \nsamenhangen. Een verandering binnen een van de thema\u2019s raakt altijd aan de \nandere, en een optimale balans is lastig te bepalen. Zo zorgen soepelere regels \nom innovatie te stimuleren ervoor dat geneesmiddelen sneller op de markt \nbeschikbaar zijn. Als keerzijde daarvan is er minder kennis over de veiligheid en \neffectiviteit op het moment dat een vergunning wordt verleend. Extra \nveiligheidsmaatregelen leiden daarentegen tot langere studies, en daarmee tot \nhogere kosten voor (de ontwikkeling van) geneesmiddelen en een beperktere \nbeschikbaarheid.  \n \nBovendien hebben factoren buiten het geneesmiddelensysteem invloed op de \nvier thema\u2019s, zoals commerci\u00eble belangen en de besluitvorming over de \nnationale vergoeding van geneesmiddelen. Ook ontbreekt op meerdere terreinen \ntransparantie, bijvoorbeeld in de opbouw van kosten of de uitwisseling van data.  \n \nAangezien belangen per partij verschillen (van industrie, tot verzekeraars, \npati\u00ebnten en zorgprofessionals), is het lastig om een balans te vinden die alle \npartijen tevreden stelt. Bij eventuele aanpassingen aan het systeem is het van \nbelang hiermee rekening te houden. Pati\u00ebnten met een ernstige ziekte waarvoor \nnog geen behandeling beschikbaar is, zullen bijvoorbeeld meer risico\u2019s \naccepteren \nop \nhet \ngebied \nvan \nveiligheid \nen \neffectiviteit \ndan \ngeneesmiddelenbeoordelaars of het algemene publiek. \n \n \n\nRIVM Report  \n Page 4 of 77 \nAbstract \nMinds Open \u2013 sustainability of the European regulatory system for \nmedicinal products.  \n \nThe European system for the production, authorization and marketing of \nmedicinal products is strongly regulated. Medicines have to meet predetermined \nstandards concerning safety, quality and efficacy before they are granted market \nauthorization. Safeguarding these standards does not stop at the moment of \nmarket authorization. During the time an authorized medicinal product is \navailable on the market, it is subject to a continuous process of surveillance.  \nThe regulation supporting this process of continuous surveillance has expanded \nincreasingly and is affecting the amount of innovation of new medicinal \nproducts, the availability and the costs of medicinal products. Against this \nbackground, the question whether the current regulatory system for medicinal \nproducts is still sustainable in future has come to the fore. \n \nThe RIVM analyzed potential vulnerabilities in the current regulatory system with \na focus on the themes safety & efficacy, innovation, costs and availability of \n(new) medicinal products. \nThis report shows that these themes show a strong interdependency and cannot \nbe separated easily. Interventions in one theme will have an effect on another \ntheme or even on multiple themes; e.g. more attention to safety and efficacy \nwill lead to higher costs and a decline in both innovation and availability of \nmedicinal products. The four main themes can be seen as four gear wheels. \nWhen one wheel is being turned, the others are also set in motion.  \n \nFurthermore, during this study the themes \u2018transparency\u2019 and \u2018accountability\u2019 \nwere also found to be important.

We calculate \nour scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and \nCorporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol). In so far as possible, any known deviations from \nthe GHG Protocol are documented.  \n \nOrganisational boundary \nSustainability performance data is collected from across our global operations on an operational control basis. We aim to account for \n100% of the data from wholly owned operations and subsidiaries; majority owned jointly controlled entities and associates, where we \nhave an equity stake of \u226551%; and minority owned jointly controlled entities and associates, where we have an equity stake of \u226450% \nand retain management control.  \n \nAcquisitions and divestments \nWe aim to fully integrate any acquired entities from our data collection, consolidation and reporting processes within the first \ncalendar year following acquisition. For divested entities that are financially classified as \u201cdiscontinued operations\u201d (divested or held \nfor sale), all current year and historical performance data, including normalised data from the discontinued operation, will be excluded \nfrom the consolidation process for the reporting year in which the divestment took place, with the exception of disclosure within our \nStreamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) statement. For any divested entities that are not financially classified as \ndiscontinued operations, performance data will be included in current year up to the time of sale completion.  In subsequent \nreporting years all data including historical and normalised data from the divested entity will be excluded from the consolidation \nprocess. Where an acquisition or divestment is material, with the inclusion or removal of the entity\u2019s data results in a variation that \nexceeds \u00b1 5% of the original, historical data will be restated where attainable. We aim to restate data for a minimum of two years prior \nto acquisition or divestment, which may include restating target baselines where appropriate. \n \nReporting period \nThe reporting period for our sustainability performance metrics is aligned to our financial reporting period, from 1 January through to \n31 December. Where it is not possible to provide complete data within this timeframe, for example due to a lag in energy invoicing for \nscope 1 + 2 emissions calculations, then actual data is collected for the period from January to October inclusive. This is then adjusted \nto the full reporting period through the application of an appropriate adjustment factor.  \n \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022 ROLLS-ROYCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS  \n\u2022 BASIS OF REPORTING  \n\n \nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BASIS OF REPORTING | Published 1st March 2023 \nData quality \nThe aim of our reporting processes is to provide data that is complete, accurate and relevant to our operations. For any data that is \nsubsequently found to be materially in error following reporting or where conversion factors may have materially changed, then this \nwill be clearly indicated and the data restated for purposes of baselines and trend analysis. For the purposes of materiality, we aim for \neach reported performance metric to be within \u00b1 5% of the true figure. All reported figures are subsequently reviewed during the \nnext reporting cycle and where this results in a variation that exceeds \u00b1 5% of the original will be restated.  \n \nThe Audit Committee, as a subcommittee of the Board, reviews and approves the data collection and calculation process and the \nconsolidated metrics prior to external disclosure.   \n \n\n \nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BASIS OF REPORTING | Published 1st March 2023 \nScope 1 + Scope 2 emissions  \n \nDefinitions \n\u201cScope 1 emissions\u201d accounts for direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the company. \n\u201cScope 2 emissions\u201d accounts for indirect emissions associated with the generation of imported/ purchased electricity, heat or steam.  \n \nScope and boundary \nReported emissions include greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations; including our facilities and manufacturing \nactivities.  \n \nUnits \nFor the purposes of statutory reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are expressed both as an absolute amount in kilotonnes of carbon \ndioxide equivalent (ktCO2e) and as an intensity in kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per million pounds sterling of group \nrevenues (ktCO2e/\u00a3m). \n \nGreenhouse gas emissions are expressed as a consolidated figure, adjusted to reflect the full reporting period through the application \nof an adjustment factor.

The 17 political goals are intended to promote sustainable development world-\nwide at the economic, social, and environmental levels and are aimed not only at governments worldwide, but \nalso at civil society, the private sector, and academia. Through its business activities, Sartorius particularly con-\ntributes to the achievement of nine of the global sustainability goals. The focus is on goal number 3 for \u201cgood \nhealth and well-being,\u201d which is addressed by the company\u2019s business model.  \n \nSartorius operates in the life science sector \u2013 more precisely, in the field of medical biotechnology. As a partner \nto the biopharmaceutical industry, the Group manufactures products and process technologies that are used \nin the development and production of biological medicines and vaccines. In this context, the Group places a \nparticular focus on innovations that make it possible to increase the safety, speed, and efficiency of the devel-\nopment and production process for such active ingredients. This allows new therapies to be made available to \npatients earlier, at lower prices, and to a larger number of patients.  \nThe biopharmaceutical industry plays a crucial role in the development of new drugs and vaccines to prevent \nand treat diseases, some of which were previously incurable.

Turning pledges and commitments \ninto real action requires effort; however, it is essential now that the scale of the problem is better understood, \nand the solutions made clearer. \nWe might well wish for a more stable geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop for what is a substantial task. \nBut we can\u2019t afford to let the urgent distract from the existential and wait for conditions to improve.\nWith that in mind, and to sharpen our analysis of the progress made by our investee companies, we have \nenhanced our proprietary sustainability ratings to include assessments of both the financial, and non-financial \nimpacts, of company actions. This is what is known as \u2018double materiality\u2019 and it is crucial to compiling a \nforward-looking view on the sustainability profiles of corporate issuers. \nAsset managers have a choice to engage or divest, or a combination of both. As active managers, we have \npreferred to engage with companies where their transition plans fall short. Getting from brown to green is the \npriority, not just in portfolios but in aggregate across the world. To that end we are employing a climate rating to \nidentify the companies with whom we should prioritise engagement to meet our net zero goals.\nBy working with other investors in this area, through groups such as Climate Action 100+, we can share \nknowledge and investment policies, engaging directly with management to focus improvements on areas that \nneed it most.\nFinally, sustainable investing is as important to private markets as public ones. Private markets give investors \naccess to those smaller-scale firms working on green technology to reshape industries, as well as renewable \nenergy projects. \nSustainability is complex and, like most areas of finance, constantly evolving. It requires us to iterate our own \nprocesses to keep pace with change and ensure our investment ambitions remain high. \nAnne Richards \nCEO, Fidelity International\n\nOverview: ESG 2.0\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n06\nSection 1: ESG integration at Fidelity   \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n11\n     2021 update\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n\t\n13\n     Ratings 2.0\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n       \t15\n     High impact\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n       \t20\n     Allocating for climate change  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n       22\nSection 2: Active ownership at Fidelity  \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n24\n     Engagement in 2021\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n             \t 26 \n     Voting in 2021\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n\t\n\t\n       27\t\n     Sustainable investing themes \t\t\n \t\n\t\n\t\n           \t 28\n     Environment \t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n   \t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n    \t 30 \n\t\nClimate\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n        \t \t\n31\n\t\nNature\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n        \t \t\n40\n     Social \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n   \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n    \t 46 \n\t\nEmployees \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n        ", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

Though extreme weather \nconditions and bureaucratic \ndifficulties threatened to derail \ntheir plans, the duo persevered, \ncompleting all three stages of \ntheir expedition and collecting \nimportant scientific data to help \nus better understand the impact \nof climate change. As part of our \nCorporate Citizenship program \nsupporting projects in \nwww.nanokexpedition.be\neducation, innovation and \nsustainability, Solvay was one of \nthe main sponsors of the \nexpedition.\n\u201cOur expedition had a scientific \npart and a human part,\u201d explains \nNathan. \u201cScientific because we \nwanted the expedition to have a \npurpose related to the \nenvironment and climate \nchange, and human because we \nwanted to give a message to \npeople, to encourage people to \nbelieve in and follow their \ndreams.\u201d\n\u201cI like to think that in terms of  \nscience, awareness and values, \nexplorers have a lot to \ncontribute,\u201d says Gilles. \u201cWe can \nbring messages, such as \ncourage, resilience and \nperseverance through difficult \ntimes.

The pandemic naturally led to a huge increase  \nin demand for our disinfectant brands like Dettol and Lysol, hygiene \nOur Compass\nRejuvenating growth, sustainably\nReckitt\u2019s purpose is to protect, heal and nurture \nin the relentless pursuit of a cleaner and \nhealthier world. It\u2019s the basis of our business \nstrategy, delivered through our three business \nunits \u2013 while our sustainability agenda frames \nour ambition to make the greatest positive \nimpact we can on society and the planet.\n \nOur purpose\nTo protect, heal and nurture in the relentless pursuit  \nof a cleaner, healthier world.\nOur fight\nMaking access to the highest quality hygiene, wellness  \nand nourishment a right, not a privilege.\nprotection being the first step in reducing transmission. Our immediate \npriority was to help people by keeping our operations running safely and \nmaking a huge amount of extra product available. And we played our \npart in getting the hygiene message out through one of the largest \npublic health education campaigns in history. \nDettol\u2019s #HandWashChallenge, which encouraged people to wash their \nhands, started in India in April and by November 2020 had generated \nmore than 125 billion views around the world. This was no traditional \npublic health campaign. Using TikTok, it invited people to create their \nown dance moves around washing their hands, set to a bespoke \nsoundtrack with a branded Dettol banner.\nSocietal impact through our purpose-led brands\u2026 \nThis is a core example of Reckitt\u2019s philosophy of empowering people to \nimprove their own hygiene, wellbeing and nutrition. It\u2019s why all our brands \nare increasingly following a purpose-led path, starting with innovation, \nwhich maximises the benefits to consumers while balancing the wider \nimpacts we have on society. Many of our brands already champion an \nissue which is authentically and meaningfully connected with the \nproduct. For example, Vanish and its partnership with British Fashion \nWeek, promotes cleaning and reusing clothes while Dettol and Harpic \nfocus on water and sanitation for health and hygiene.\nOur bold ambition by 2030 is to reach half the world with brands that \nhelp people live cleaner, healthier lives and enable a cleaner, healthier \nworld. We also aim to engage two billion people each year to make a \npositive societal impact, through our partnerships, programmes and \ncampaigns. Whether through our brands or our Fight for Access Fund,  \nor our value chain, the impacts we create contribute towards delivering \nthe UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \nAnd our target by 2022 is for all of our global brands to deliver on their \npurpose and build connected causes, aligned with the SDGs, that we \nshould fight for, and ", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

This new approach brings \ntogether PwC\u2019s unique combination of people, powered by \ntechnology, to deliver on the intertwined needs of trust and sustained \noutcomes that our clients and wider society are seeking in this time of \nprofound change and uncertainty. \nAs competition and societal expectations grow more intense both in \nSingapore and around the world, environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) has assumed an increasingly important role as \norganisations seek to deliver sustainable outcomes more than just \nshort-term solutions.\nIn a signi\ufb01cant step toward achieving our net zero greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions commitment by 2030, our climate targets and \ntimeline have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative \n(SBTi). In alignment with SBTi\u2019s highest ambition level, PwC is \ncommitted to decarbonising the way we operate and decoupling our \nbusiness growth from emissions. \nSustainability Report  |  3\nWe are particularly proud to have launched our Asia Paci\ufb01c Centre for Sustainability Excellence (CSE) \nsupported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, which aims to help organisations across Asia \nPaci\ufb01c achieve ESG excellence through decarbonisation, climate risk management, sustainable \ufb01nance and \ninvestment, sustainability reporting and assurance, and other measures. Together with this Centre, we have \nalso launched the Singapore Low Carbon Network (SLCN) to bring together organisations across Singapore \nthat share ambitions to decarbonise, and advance the sharing of best practices and insights on key carbon \nmeasurement and decarbonisation topics. We look forward to sharing more on this in the next issue of our \nSustainability Report.\nIn our 2022 \ufb01nancial year, we will be setting new carbon emission reduction targets, taking much bolder \nsteps in lowering our emissions, and boosting our performance in ESG through our ESG framework that \ninvolves six key strategies - focus on our net zero commitment, a circular supply chain, strategic \npartnerships, inclusion, diversity and wellbeing of our people, creating an ESG conscious workforce, and \nimpact-driven community outreach. We are also upskilling our people in this area and empowering them to \nbe part of our climate action journey. This will be an extension of our continued e\ufb00orts and progress \nachieved through initiatives such as using 100% renewable energy for electricity along with  o\ufb00setting \n100% of our air travel for the past three years, while supporting our stakeholders with their ESG \ntransformation journey. \nOur people are our biggest success factor and it is vital that we create a safe, inclusive and supportive \nenvironment for them - one which empowers them to be well mentally, physically, socially, emotionally and \n\ufb01nancially. As we transition to endemic living, it is important that we continue to help our people remain \nresilient while ensuring that they have meaningful and sustainable careers.\nThe past year has also shone a spotlight on wellness. At PwC Singapore, while we were able to adapt to \nremote and \ufb02exible work arrangements quickly and well, during this challenging year also saw us enhance \nour wellness programme through various initiatives that focused on maki", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0, "renewable_energy_percent": 100.0}}}}

IDENTITY AND STRATEGY\nSUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022\n\nLetter to Stakeholders\n2022 has been a difficult year. Despite a significant growth in the top line, \nmarginality has suffered.\nThe increase of raw material costs has not reflected timely and fully \nin consequent prices raise on the market, and we have not been \nable to mitigate the gap through operational excellence. On \ncontrary, we have recognized several disruptions in supply \nchain, leading in missing components which have jeopardized \nour delivery performance. In addition to this critical situation, \nfew production bottlenecks, not helping the overall score with \ncustomers, have surfaced. \nBooking trend has been quite strong, also due to an abnormal \ndilatation of lead times.\n2023 will be the year of inverting the trend on marginality. Thanks to \ncapacity issues being addressed and general improvements in the whole \nsupply chain, top line will continue to grow but at a slower pace and on time delivery \nwill become a sane obsession. We shall embrace and leverage our fundamentals, quality and customization, to \nconcentrate on operational excellence and rigorous costs control, guarantying value creation to our customers \nand reaffirming our strong positioning in the market as partner of choice for electrical motors and integrated \nautomated solutions.\nWith a view to continuous improvement, we have set ourselves the goal of outlining a path of growth in \nsustainability, reflecting both our commitment to sustainable development and the growing strategic importance \nwe attach to ESG issues. \nIn fact, during the year 2022 Lafert confirmed his commitment and sensitivity towards these issues not only by \nfollowing up the Sustainability Report for the year 2021 but elaborating his first Home-Work Travel Plan (or \nHWTP) with a view to reducing CO2 emissions by identifying alternative measures to use the private car to reach \nthe workplace. \nSustainability has become a daily commitment for Lafert to the point that the company has earned the Ecol Design \nAward 2022, a recognition created to reward the most virtuous companies that are committed to the sustainability \nof their activities and their plants by taking all possible measures to improve their environmental impact.\nIn this context, the renewal of the Group\u2019s Code of Ethics and Conduct, as well as the implementation of a Code \nof Ethics addressed to suppliers (whose subscription is in the process of being signed) redefining the fundamental \nvalues of conduct that inspire and guide the activity not only of all employees of the Lafert Group, but of the entire \nsupply chain; during the year 2022 the Organization, Management and Control Model according to D.lgs. n. \n231/2001 was also made official.\nThe year 2023 is characterized by the same sensitivity: in March the first Lafert Group Sustainability Plan was \napproved by the Board of Directors. This document outlines 82 objectives that we are committed to achieve over \nthe next three years in the environmental, social and governance fields, which can be perfectly expressed in a \nsingle ambitious medium-long-term su", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

The report is \nbeing published at a very special time, not only from the point of view of our company but also from the point \nof view of the entire global economy, society, our employees, their relatives and friends. This is the fifth edition \nof our non-financial report and we are once again closing it at uncertain times. In 2020, the pandemic \npresented a challenge for our organization. Today, we are dealing with Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine. Our \nresponsible approach has been demonstrated by our involvement in the fight against the coronavirus and \nnow by showing our solidarity with Ukraine. Since the very early days of the invasion, we have been offering \nnumerous free telecommunication services to the refugees from Ukraine, and together with ZE PAK we \ndonated  PLN 5 million to \u201cPolsat Foundation for the Children of Ukraine\u201d action.  \nBearing in mind the numerous groups of our stakeholders, I sincerely trust that everyone will find something \nof interest in this report \u2013 from the overview of our business, through the presentation of our Strategy 2023+,   \nto the description of the activities that we embarked upon in the areas of natural environment, the society and \ncorporate governance. This year\u2019s edition of our report covers the Group\u2019s main companies \u2013 Cyfrowy Polsat, \nPolkomtel, TV Polsat and Netia Capital Group. \n2021 was a year of many challenges. Here is the review of the most important ones. \nChoose your everything. You rule! \nMid-last year we announced changes in our Group.

We were able \nto take advantage of favorable market conditions, \nparticularly in North America, and the efficient \ndeployment of our global industrial system to generate \nstrong increases in sales and margins through the year. \nOur sales grew 80% to USD 11.8 billion, our  \nEBITDA rose to USD 3.6 billion, and our net income \nrose to USD 2.5 billion, or 22% of net sales. With a \nsolid balance sheet and good prospects for an increase \nin cash \ufb02ow in the year ahead, we are proposing to \nraise our dividend for the 2022 year by 24% to USD \n0.51 per share. \nWe produced over 3.5 million tons of steel pipes \nworldwide, sustaining an ongoing ramp up of our \nfacilities in the USA and high levels of production \nthroughout our industrial system. Despite the use of \nlonger and more complex production and logistics \nroutes, we were able to maintain high standards for \nsafety, product quality and consumption of materials.\nDuring the year, we hired 6,500 new employees \nand, in our induction training routines, we paid \nclose attention to the importance of having a safety \nmindset with awareness and behaviors suitable for \nthe industrial environment of our shop \ufb02oor. We \nempower all our employees to be proactive in always \ntaking preventive safety actions. Our lost time injury \nfrequency rate for the year declined by 10% to 0.9 \nper million man hours worked. We are grateful to our \npeople working in the plant for their contribution to \nthis result.\nWe increased the deployment of our Rig Direct\u00ae \nservices. We are now serving over 500 rigs directly \nworldwide. Our unique service platform allows us \nto integrate our operations more closely with our \ncustomers, minimizing material production and \ufb02ows, \nand provide digital and technical services that can \nfurther differentiate us from our competitors. \nAs we increased production, sales and service, \nour logistics operations have reached a substantial \nmagnitude. To give an idea of the efforts involved, \nbetween inter-mill transportation and delivery to \ncustomers, we moved around 10 million tons of \nmaterial all around the world. We are strengthening \nthe reliability of our supply chain through the \ndigitalization of our material \ufb02ows.\n2022 marked a turning point in our deployment in \nthe United States. The country accounted for more \nthan 40% of our total sales, most of which are now \nproduced locally. We brought the Bay City mill to full \nproduction capacity and ramped up production in the \nrest of our US industrial system including the restart \nof production of welded pipes and of heat treatment \nand \ufb01nishing at our Baytown and Koppel sites. We \nhired more than 1,500 new employees during the year \nand now employ 3,600 persons in the country. \nChairman\u2019s \nLetter \n\n4\nAs we look ahead, we view that the current balance in \nthe oil market and high demand for LNG will support \noil and gas prices and investment in the sector. We \nexpect that the number of oil and gas wells drilled \naround the world in 2023 will increase and this will \ndrive global OCTG demand to around 16 million tons \nto reach its highest level since 2014.\nWith the increase in activity, we expect further \nsales and cash \ufb02ow growth with increases in sales \nto offshore developments, in the Middle East and in \npipeline infrastructure in South America. \nOur achievements over the past year that will support \nthis growth include: our multi-year agreement with \nExxonMobil to supply their offshore operations in \nGuyana; our agreements with Petrobras to supply \ntheir pre-salt operations; the renewal of our long-\nterm worldwide agreement with ENI; the renewal \nof our long-term agreement with QatarGas and \nthe consolidation of our long-term agreement with \nADNOC. We also extended our long-term agreements \nwith YPF and Pemex and were awarded supply \nagreements for major gas pipeline projects for the \nVaca Muerta \ufb01eld in Argentina and the North Field \nexpansion in Qatar.\nThe sustainability of our operations worldwide \ndepends on the support and development of our local \ncommunities. Safety and care for the environment \nare paramount, as is support for employee and \ncommunity development. Given its essential role in \nprogress and development, we have put education  \nat the core of our community activities. \nThe energy transition is progressing, but its pace \nwi", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

I am \nproud to say that all our teams \nthroughout our regions have \nresponded magnificently; as \nwell as continuing to serve our \ncommunities, we have stayed \ntrue to our commitment to \nsustainable development, \nwhich is an essential part of \nour ambitious vision to become \na leading bottler in the global \nCoca-Cola system. \nThere have been numerous challenges in all \nmarkets where Swire Coca-Cola operates, \nhowever we remain focused on continuing \nto deliver on our 2025 and 2030 sustainable \ndevelopment targets as detailed in our \nsustainability strategy, \u201cOur Choice, Our \nFuture!\u201d. \nThe successful execution of our strategy \ngreatly depends on the People and culture \nembedded in our company. Our continued \nfocus on the safety of our employees \nresulted in a continued reduction in our \ntotal injury rate (TIR) of 3% compared to \nthe previous year. In 2021, we launched our \n\u201cZero is Possible\u201d programme, underpinned \nby a continuous improvement framework, \nwhich emphasises our vision to become a \nzero harm organisation and belief that all \naccidents are avoidable and preventable.\nare determined to continue to invest and \nbring in new technological interventions to \nensure that we exceed these targets.\nDuring these challenging times, it has been \nmore important than ever to continue \nto contribute to, and partner with, the \nCommunities in which we operate. In 2021, \nwe invested over HK$15 million (0.6% of \nour annual profit), in various community \nactivities across all our markets. We also \ncontinued to meet the changing needs \nof our consumers by providing a greater \nvariety of drinks with more low and no-\nsugar options and continue to develop \nProduct packaging that is fully recyclable \nand with increased recycled PET content. \nAs the world emerges and recovers from \nthe pandemic there is still uncertainty and \nchallenges that we will all face. One thing \nthat we can be certain about is that Swire \nCoca-Cola is committed to our long-term \nsustainable development strategy and \nwill continue to transparently report our \nprogress. I hope you enjoy reading our 2021 \nSustainable Development Report.\n \nKaren So\nManaging Director\nSwire Coca-Cola Limited\nIn addition to the challenges from the \npandemic, we have also witnessed the \nimpact from Climate change on the \npeople and the communities in which \nwe operate.

Therefore, with this report, we aim to \nprovide an accessible update on how we are tackling \nthe challenges presented by climate change, as well \nas meeting our regulatory requirements aligned to the \nrecommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TCFD).\nThe Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited \n(RPTCL), the corporate Trustee of the railways pension \nschemes, remains focused on our mission to pay \npensions securely, affordably, and sustainably. We are \nsupported in managing climate risks and opportunities \nby our wholly-owned subsidiary, Railway Pension \nInvestments Limited (Railpen). Railpen\u2019s purpose is \n\u2018to secure our members\u2019 future\u2019, and through its \ngovernance and operating arrangements, we ensure \nalignment with the Trustee\u2019s mission, giving us both a \nclear line of sight of our shared objectives.\nBoth the physical impacts of climate change as well \nas the actions taken to mitigate those impacts, are \nfinancially material for pension schemes. This is why \nwe must try to understand the risks and opportunities \nclimate presents to our schemes, and adapt the way \nwe manage the schemes accordingly. Importantly, \nthe analysis in this report demonstrates that the best \nclimate outcome for the schemes would be where \nthe world meets the goals of the Paris Agreement in \nan orderly and just fashion. This has benefits for our \nmembers \u2013 both financially and societally \u2013 and is why \nwe continue to dedicate time and effort", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

In this report, we have \nset out ambitious targets \u2013 and we truly believe they are \nachievable. Accordingly, we are taking action to lead on \nperformance-enhancing change.\nFor example, we have achieved approximately a 50% \nreduction in green house gas (GHG) emissions \ndirectly under our control, nine years ahead of \ntarget. We\u2019ve also committed to the Science \nBased Targets initiative (SBTi): one of only \n2,811 companies worldwide and we are one \nof the 1,391 that have committed to the \nmore exacting target of reductions that \nhelp the world on the pathway to limiting \ntemperature growth to 1.5\u00b0C.\nThe Vita Group  Sustainability Report 2021\nOverview\nDriving circularity\nOptimising resources\nEmpowering people\nActing ethically\nAbout this report\n01\n\nGroup CEO\u2019s \nintroduction\nWelcome to \nThe Vita Group\u2019s first \nsustainability report\nAn introduction \nfrom our CEO \n\u201c\u0007I am incredibly proud \nto lead this exceptional \nbusiness with a diverse and \ntalented workforce, who \nhave a wealth of experience \nand a passion for success.\u201d\n\tIan Robb\n\t Ian Robb, Group CEO\nThe Vita Group  Sustainability Report 2021\n02\nOverview\nDriving circularity\nOptimising resources\nEmpowering people\nActing ethically\nAbout this report\n\nOur first sustainability report\nWelcome to The Vita Group\u2019s first sustainability \nreport. I want to begin by thanking all the people \nacross Vita who are working hard to make us a  \nmore sustainable business. Their smart thinking, \nproblem-solving and commitment enable us to  \nkeep up a rapid pace of innovation.\nWhile this may be our first report, sustainability  \nand environmental, social, governance (ESG) are, \nof course, nothing new to Vita. For over 70 years, \nwe have been striving to improve our processes \nand develop new technology to reduce our \nenvironmental impact.\nEarly in 2021, we published our ESG \u2018Vision\u2019 \ndocument, \u2018Enhancing Everyday Life\u2019  \n(https://www.thevitagroup.com/contacts/driving-\ncircularity-enhancing-everyday-life/) which will \nensure we continue to stretch ourselves and \ninnovate. We articulated four principles and  \n11 underlying goals in that document and, in this \nreport, we\u2019ll be explaining the progress we\u2019ve made.\nProgress in the year\nDuring 2021, we mapped our Scope 1, 2 and \n3 emissions ahead of schedule. We have now \ncommitted, through SBTi to reduce Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions by 46% and Scope 3 by 13% by 2030  \nvs the 2019 Baseline. Our Scope 1 and 2 targets are  \nin line with the very stringent 1.5oC climate pathway.  \nWe decided to set this aggressive target as we have \ndirect control over these emissions. For Scope 3,  \nwe have adopted the 2oC pathway as these are  \nnot in our direct control. \nIn 2021 we are delighted to announce we have \nreduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by \napproximately 50% and therefore 9 years ahead of \ntarget. This achievement was primarily driven by our \npolicy decision in 2019 to buy renewable electricity \nwherever possible. By the end of 2022 all our  \nsites will use renewable electricity.\nLast year, we undertook a comprehensive materiality \nexercise to ensure that our sustainability and ESG \nefforts remain focused on the most salient issues \nfor our stakeholders. The assessment embraced \nthe \u2018double materiality\u2019 concept, considering our \nimpact on society and the environment, in addition \nto financial materiality. The senior management  \nteam were active participants in the exercise.\nOur safety performance through the y", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

And \nI\u2019m pleased to share the results of our collective efforts in \nthis, Trex\u2019s third annual ESG report. \nEnvironmental sustainability is at the core of our \nproducts and operations\nWe strengthened our long-term strategy to convert \nconsumers from the use of wood products to eco-friendly \nTrex composite decking, which is made from 95% recycled \nand reclaimed materials. Our manufacturing process \nupcycles these materials by transforming them into higher-\nvalue products. In 2020, we upcycled more than 900 \nmillion pounds of plastic film and reclaimed wood, most of \nwhich would otherwise be destined for landfills. \nWe made further strides in minimizing the environmental \nimpact of Trex operations even as our company grew. \nNearly all of our factory scrapped boards are recycled \nback into the manufacturing process and used to \nmake new products. Additionally, our ongoing efforts \nto improve energy efficiency in our plants helped \nreduce the company\u2019s energy use related to cooling by \napproximately 40% in 2020.\nWe were honored to receive the 2020 Sustainability \nLeadership Award from Business Intelligence Group \nin recognition of our commitment to environmentally \nresponsible manufacturing, as well as our commercial and \ncommunity recycling programs. Consumers also continue \nto recognize the company\u2019s sustainability benefits, with \nGreen Builder readers in North America voting Trex the \n\u201cgreenest decking\u201d for the 11th straight year in 2021. \nAmid the pandemic, we immediately prioritized our \nemployees\u2019 health and well-being\nOur Crisis Management Team developed a COVID-19 \npandemic response plan that incorporated guidance and \nrequirements from health authorities to continue our \nessential manufacturing operations under safe conditions. \n\nMessage from Our CEO\nAbout Trex\n2020 Highlights\nMaterial Topics\nEnvironment\nPeople\nGovernance\nSASB Index\nAbout This Report\nTrex | 2020 ESG Report\n3\nWe supported our workers in manufacturing \nand office-based roles with revised safe working \narrangements. And, we provided flexible time for \nall employees affected by the COVID-19 pandemic \n\u2014 whether to recover from the virus, safely \nquarantine, look after a family member or \nto manage childcare.\nOur team\u2019s creativity and dedication are \npowering rapid expansion\nDespite the headwinds of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nwe completed a $200 million multi-year expansion \nprogram in the first half of 2021 that increased \nTrex production capacity by 70% when compared \nto 2019 levels. This is good news not just for our \ncustomers and business but also for our recycling \nefforts. As Trex continues to grow, we will upcycle \nmore reclaimed wood and polyethylene waste \u2014 \nresulting in more plastic film being diverted from \nlandfills and further reducing its environmental \nimpact \u2014 while providing customers with \nsustainable outdoor living options.\nWe foster a culture that upholds the values \nof diversity, equity and inclusion\nWe\u2019re mindful of the need for all Trex employees \nto feel respected and empowered to perform at \ntheir best. In 2020, we focused on identifying \nunconscious bias in Trex\u2019s hiring practices and on \nreimagining our recruitment advertising to reflect \nbroader ethnic and gender diversity. We reviewed \nour compensation practices and were pleased to \nfind no gender pay gap.

Just what does all of this have to do with ESG?  \nOur answer: A great deal. It stands for the \u201cS\u201c in ESG or in \u201cSocial\u201c and, in this specific \ncase, represents the warm and friendly get-together on UBM\u2019s Family Day.\nSo, what exactly is a Family Day? It is a wonderful event where the children of UBM\u2019s \nemployees see where their parents work. And paint bird boxes \u2013 along with an office \nchair or two. But that\u2019s no problem \u2013 it\u2019s all part of our social competence. As an \nemployer, we support the community, as a developer we create properties for  \ngenerations to come, and as a company we want to be a good corporate citizen. \nAccepting responsibility for others and for society can also be a lot of fun.\nThe past year was, by far, not nearly as much fun \u2013 from an economic standpoint and \nalso for the environment. We are, without doubt, at a turning point. This is true for our \nsector and also for global warming. 2022 was the second warmest year in Austria since \nthe start of record-keeping. And UBM was, unfortunately, unable to deliver the same \ntop results as in the past two crisis years.

We thoroughly support the Financial \nReporting Council\u2019s work in Stewardship and Governance.\nAs a quality growth, long-term investor, we look for companies that can deliver sustainable \ninvestment returns. We believe that value creation is enhanced when companies deliver social \nutility, while limiting negative impact to the environment. ESG analysis is therefore fully integrated \nwithin our fundamental research on each company and throughout our investment decision-\nmaking process. As active owners, we strive to improve ESG practices through targeted company \nengagements and by voicing our opinions through responsible voting. Importantly, our interests are \nfocused on the long-term and aligned with our clients because of our broad employee partnership \nmodel. \nOver the past year, we have witnessed a sharp increase in the volume of ESG information requested \nby our clients. Our segregated mandate clients are also integrating increasingly bespoke ESG \ntailoring to meet their needs and organisational goals. We continue to add resources to ensure we \ncan meet these demands and add value to our clients in their ESG journeys. In 2023, as a signatory \nto the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative, we published our first climate-related targets.  \nThese targets allow us to both prioritise our engagement resources on companies facing the most \nsignificant climate risks and to assess the sustainability of their business models. \nWe acknowledge that there is a need for ongoing learning and development. We continue to face \na changing regulatory landscape and increasingly bespoke client needs. We have made further \ninvestments in ESG resources, servicing capabilities and operational infrastructure. We are also \ncarefully ensuring that all teams at Comgest absorb and apply ESG knowledge.

USACE Sustainability Plan Summary \nThe Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works (ASA(CW)) is the Chief \nSustainability Officer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and is committed \nto achieving the goals of Executive Order (E.O.) 14057 and reducing scope 1, 2, and 3 \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in support of the whole-of-government approach for \nfederal sustainability. USACE employs a systems-based approach to achieving \nsustainability goals, leveraging annual investment strategies, holistic planning and \nimplementation, performance reviews across all command levels, and course \nadjustments as directed by the USACE Strategic Sustainability Committee (SSC). \nUSACE's sustainability strategy prioritizes efforts to transition its fleet to 100% zero-\nemission vehicles (ZEV) through phasing in light-duty (LD) ZEV acquisitions and \ninstalling electric vehicle (EV) supply equipment (EVSE). Efforts to build a more climate- \nand sustainability-focused workforce and to address environmental justice (EJ) \nconsiderations have been incorporated throughout the planning and implementation of \nthe ZEV and EVSE strategies. In addition, USACE is working to improve its buildings, \ncampuses, and installations through on-site carbon pollution-free electricity (CFE) \ngeneration, net-zero design and construction, implementation of energy and water use \nefficiency measures, waste and pollution reduction, and sustainable procurement. \n \n2. Priority Actions \nA. 100 Percent Carbon Pollution-Free Electricity \nUSACE is taking action to increase CFE to 100% by 2030 with up to 50% on a 24/7 \nbasis. To achieve this goal, priority actions achieved in FY2022 include the following: \n\u2022 Consumed at least 7.5% legacy renewables to be counted towards the CFE target, \nper Section 203 of the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 2005 Cap of 7.5% of total \nelectricity consumption. \n\u2022 Installed solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on Federal Land at Eau Galle River Lake \nProject in Wisconsin with a generation capacity of 7 kilowatts; 835 kilowatt hours \n(kWh) were generated in June 2022. \n\u2022 Quantified emissions from purchased electricity by region using the Environmental \nProtection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database \nto prioritize new cost-effective CFE installation sites, several of which are already \nplanned or in contracting phase across USACE, based on electricity rates and on-\nsite renewable potential. \n \nB. 100 Percent Zero-Emission Vehicle Fleet \nIn addition to phasing in LD ZEV acquisitions, USACE is focusing on strategic siting and \ninstallation of EVSE infrastructure through priority actions achieved in FY2022: \n\u2022 Identified approximately 296 ports for EVSE installation at 55 locations (as of July \n2022) using the results of the DATABOOK, a USACE-specific Excel spreadsheet \ntool populated with agency fleet data and other logistical, social, and environmental \nfactors, and two virtual site assessments, the Data Call for Civil Works (CW) facilities \nand Daily Tasking Order (DTO) for Revolving Fund (RF) facilities in FY2022 Q2. \n\u2022 Leveraged $8 million (M) in appropriations to begin implementation of EVSE \ninfrastructure at identified and prioritized sites through U.S. Army Engineering and \nSupport Center, Huntsville\u2019s (HNC) pre-existing multiple award task order contract \n\n2 \n \n(MATOC) Facilities Repair & Renewal (FRR) Program, which offers a fast-track \nmethod for design and construction at USACE project sites. \n \nC. Net-Zero Emissions Buildings, Campuses, and Installations \ni. Design and Construction for Net-Zero Emissions \nTo reduce GHG emissions from its buildings\u2019 portfolio by 50% by FY2032 and \nachieve net-zero emissions by FY2045 from the FY2008 baseline, USACE took \nthe following FY2022 actions: \n\u2022 Began in June 2022 identifying opportunities at the U.S. Army Engineer \nResearch and Development Center (ERDC)\u2019s Construction Engineering \nResearch Laboratory to advance and deploy carbon sequestering materials \nand low-GHG design approaches for USACE\u2019s civil facilities and infrastructure \nfootprint, including water-related infrastructure such as dams, recreation areas, \nhydropower plants, locks, canals, and water storage to reduce lifecycle GHG \nemissions by over 50% relative to current practices. \n \nii.  Increasing Energy Efficiency \nUSACE is implementing the following priority actions in FY2022 to increase facility \nenergy efficiency across the agency's building portfolio: \n\u2022 Identified 85 energy conservation measures (ECMs) in FY2022 through 8 \ncovered facility audits; began implementation of three ECMs including two \nboiler plant improvements at ERDC and reached the measurement and \nverification phase in an energy savings performance contract (ESPC) at the \nHumph", "output": {"disclosures": {"unspecified": {"scope_1_emissions": 2.0}}}}

With this an-\nnual report, we present an insight into our \nsustainability management and the various \nways of how we continuously improve the \neconomic, environmental, and social im-\npacts of our activities.\nIn 2022, the business environment con-\ntinued to be volatile with the war in Ukraine, \nhigh inflation rates, rising energy prices, is-\nsues in international supply chains, and \nthe continued Covid-19 infections and miti- \ngation activities. Despite all this, we have \nfirmly kept our focus on sustainability. We \nconsider it a main contributor to value cre-\nation for all our stakeholders, as well as a \nmain contributor to fulfilling the expecta-\ntions for future growth and stability of the \ncompany.\nTherefore, we launched the True Green \nInitiative in 2022, a comprehensive pro-\ngram aimed and designed to accelerate \nand integrate sustainability with practical \nactions into everything we do, from pro-\ncesses to attitudes. Furthermore, at the \nbeginning of 2022, we took another ma-\njor step forward in sustainability, as we be-\ncame confirmedly carbon neutral in all \nour own operations, and now only offer  \nzero-emission production and services to \nour customers.\nYet we are raising our ambitions even \nfurther: we have announced our intention \nto meet the high climate standards of the  \nScience-Based Targets Initiative.

Both the genesis of the pandemic crisis and the policies to contain the contagion, \nrather than promoting economic recovery, demonstrate how sustainability is an in-\ncreasingly central value, in Italy as well as abroad. This awareness, which has already \nbeen growing for several years, has intensified during the pandemic, to the point of \nbecoming a priority in the dialogue with investors, banking and financial institutions, \nlocal administrations, trade organizations, customers and suppliers.\nAt the end of 2019, a majority of Vetrerie Riunite\u2019s equity share was acquired by an \ninvestment fund of Sun Capital, a leading American Private Equity. This new sharehold-\ner structure has provided a further stimulus to share the sustainability policies already \nin place at the Group, as well as to strengthen and complete them, with a view to \ncontinuous improvement: the Vetrerie Riunite 2020 Sustainability Report therefore \ncaptures a snapshot during a path in full evolution: not a point of arrival, but rather a \nsolid platform, to reach new horizons of advancement.\nDespite the uncertainty caused at all levels by the pandemic, 2020 was a positive year \nfor Vetrerie Riunite: starting from the second half of the year, demand was at very high \nlevels from all customers, and it is maintained as such for the entire following year. At \nthe same time, a favorable product mix and some operating efficiencies made possible \nto close a year with a growth compared to the previous one.\nThe recent acquisition of the Group also coincided with a redefinition of its strategy, \nnow more clearly oriented towards consolidating its leadership in the sector of glass \nwashing machine doors, of which Vetrerie Riunite is already the first world producer, \nwith a global market share of approximately 40%. Following this strategic affirmation, \nthe Group proceeded, at the end of 2020, to the sale of the Vetri delle Venezie business \nunit, which - in addition to contributing negatively to the Group\u2019s results - represented \na risk of out-of-focus for management and production.\nGRI 102-14 Statement from senior decision-maker\n\n6\nFor 2021, the Group aims to consolidate the growth path started in the second half of \n2020, by investing in new production capacity - which allows it to capture new demand \ntrends - and in extraordinary transactions - which contribute to consolidating market \nleadership -.
